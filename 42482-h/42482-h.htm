<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>At a time when the rich and fertile provinces
of South America are daily becoming increased
objects of commercial consideration&mdash;when their
riches and advantages are constantly forming the
bases of fresh speculations&mdash;and when, under the
security offered to person and property by the
liberal institutions of a free and independent
government, communication with them is every
hour becoming more extended,&mdash;an illustration
of their local affairs, customs, manners, and
people, cannot but be interesting.</p>

<p>Of these provinces, the one which forms the
subject of the following Remarks is far from being
the least important. Without adverting to the
fertility of the soil, and the general healthiness of
the climate, the prospects which Buenos Ayres
presents in a mercantile point of view, forming,
as she does, from her situation, the medium of
communication with the whole interior of this
vast continent, must ever render her an object of
considerable importance to a commercial nation
like England. Nor is she less a source of interest
to the politician and the philanthropist. To
Buenos Ayres is due the credit of setting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">-&nbsp;iv&nbsp;-</a></span>
noble example to the other provinces, of bursting
asunder the shackles of a despotic mother-country,
whose selfish policy had long immured them under
the deepest veil of ignorance and degradation, debarring
them from any communication with the
rest of the world, in order that she might reap
the exclusive advantage of those treasures with
which Nature had enriched them. Nor has Buenos
Ayres confined herself to example merely,
but, from the moment of having secured her own
independence, she has never ceased to encourage
and assist the other states in throwing off the
same degrading yoke.</p>

<p>It is true, that preceding works have thrown
much light on these countries, and the subjects
I have here handled have been treated by
abler pens than mine; but, besides the expensiveness
of those works, which renders them inaccessible
to a great class of readers, the subject is so
new, and embraces such a wide field of research,
that an abundant harvest still remains for fresh
labourers. Having confined myself to one portion
of this vast territory, I have been able to enter into
a minuter detail of many things that have been
cursorily passed over by preceding writers; and,
finally, having resided in the country which is the
subject of these Remarks during the last five
years, my means of observation have been neither
few nor limited.</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p><b><big>T</big></b><small>HE</small> city of Buenos Ayres, when viewed from the outer
roads at a distance of about eight miles, has an imposing
appearance. The domes of the numerous churches, the
public buildings, &amp;c. give it an air of grandeur, which a
nearer approach diminishes. On landing, the dilapidated
mole (destroyed by the storm of the 21st August, 1820)
and the mean streets near the beach, do not augur well for
the beauty of the town: it requires an inspection rightly
to appreciate it, for there are edifices worthy of attention.
When I landed, in October, 1820, two cannons, forty-two-pounders,
in very good condition, were mounted on the
mole: they had the Spanish royal arms engraven on them,
and inscriptions, purporting, that one was cast at Seville,
and the other at Lima, some sixty years since.</p>

<p>A passenger is not exposed to any particular custom-house
obstructions when he comes on shore. Should he
bring his trunks with him, he is simply requested to open
them, and a slight examination takes place. Several obnoxious
customs have lately been abolished. Formerly, a
sentinel was posted, to prevent any one passing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">-&nbsp;2&nbsp;-</a></span>
water-side at the mole without first asking permission at
the guard-house on the beach. The system of vessels
being obliged to wait, upon their arrival, in the outer roads,
for the visit of the health boat from shore, has also undergone
reform. Masters may now leave their vessels immediately.
It is necessary to go on board the gun-brig,
which is now stationed in the inner roads, and there await
the visit of the health boat, which comes off by a signal
from this brig, and very little delay occurs. Upon the old
plan, vessels often remained, through bad weather or
neglect, four or five days before they were visited; during
which time no communication was allowed with the
shore. A manifest of the cargo, the ship&rsquo;s papers,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> letters,
&amp;c. are given to the visiting officer, provided no consul or
agent of the nation whose flag the vessel bears resides in
Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>The removal of the brig of war from the outer roads has
taken away the occasion of much offence. Disputes were
continually occurring, from her firing at vessels and boats to
bring them to. The boat of the Countess of Chichester,
the first packet that arrived from Falmouth, had two shots
fired at her, when going on shore with Mr. Pousset, the
vice-consul. Captain Little, who was on board the packet
at the time, not knowing what to make of this firing, ordered
the guns to be double-shotted, and the crew to get
under arms. A representation was made, and an apology
promptly given. Serious misunderstandings, however, I
am persuaded, must, some time or other, have occurred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">-&nbsp;3&nbsp;-</a></span>
had the brig continued outside, and pursued the same
system.</p>

<p>It is only since October, 1821, that the health boat has
been regularly established. The enforcement of the quarantine
laws, and the prevention of smuggling, were the
reasons assigned for it; but there were probably other
motives, one of which might be, to prevent the boats of
British men-of-war from boarding vessels of their own nation
before their visit boat. It would, however, be difficult,
strictly to enforce the quarantine laws at Buenos Ayres.
Vessels have frequently arrived at night, or in a fog, and
the captains have come on shore without being visited, not
being aware of the regulations.</p>

<p>The outer and inner roads are, in fact, open roadsteads;
neither of them possessing good anchorage. A strong
wind from the E. or S.E. blowing almost direct on land,
is always dangerous; and vessels often drive. In the storm
of the 21st August, 1820, in which sixty vessels of all descriptions
were lost, the wind was at S.E. The winter
season is much better for shipping than the summer; as
in the latter, the wind blows fresh nearly every afternoon
from the eastward. Good anchors and cables are very
necessary in the river Plate; chain cables particularly.</p>

<p>In the outer roads, the average depth of water is 18 feet,
in the inner roads, 18: at high tides, there is 25 feet in
the outer, and 13 in the inner roads. A Pampero wind,
blowing off the land from the W. or W.S.W. causes at
times a very low river, leaving not more than 5 feet water
in the inner, and 8 in the outer roads. The banks that
divide the roads are then dry, and people ride on horseback
upon them. This extreme low tide does not often
happen. The brig Candidate, salt-laden from the Cape de
Verds, was lost, on the 13th June, 1823, near the Ortiz
bank, from an occurrence of this sort: the water having
suddenly left her, she foundered at her anchors. The
state of the tide sometimes causes great delay to vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">-&nbsp;4&nbsp;-</a></span>
leaving the inner roads; days, and even a week, being lost
at some periods.</p>

<p>Pilots, appointed and paid by the government, conduct
vessels to and from the outer and inner roads: two of them
are Englishmen, Lee and Robinson; the others are Portuguese
and Creolian, who speak a little English. The charge
for pilotage is about 10 dollars each way. Masters piloting
their own vessels, which is now and then the case, do
not thereby save the charges.</p>

<p>The port of Ensenada, situated 30 miles S.E. from Buenos
Ayres, has good anchorage; and for vessels drawing much
water, it is preferable to go thither. They incur more experience
of lighterage, if they require to be hove down; but
it is the only place appertaining to Buenos Ayres in which
it can be done, and the charge is great. Ensenada is only a
small, dull village. Mules are shipped with greater facility
there, than at Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>The Barraccas is a creek on the south of the town, in
which schooners and small craft repair their defects.</p>

<p>The river Plate may well be called the &ldquo;hell of navigators:&rdquo;
a survey of it was made by Captain Heywood, in
H.M.S. Nereus, and his chart, though not exactly correct,
is considered to be the best. Buoys have been lately
placed by the government upon the Ortiz and Chico banks;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and they have long had in agitation, the building of a
mole, a dock for shipping, and other extensive works. In
addition to a French engineer, a Quaker gentleman, named
Bevans, is engaged. He arrived from London, with his
family, in October, 1822; but, for want of means, nothing
of importance has yet been done. Raising moles and
docks is no trifling undertaking, in a country so destitute
of labourers. To remedy the latter defect, 200 Irishmen,
it is said, are coming out under the care of Colonel O&rsquo;Brien,
one of San Martin&rsquo;s officers. Mr. Bevans has been traveling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">-&nbsp;5&nbsp;-</a></span>
about the country, for the purpose of collecting information
of the requisites necessary for his undertaking: he
has, however, to encounter many obstacles. A trifling tax
on shipping would be cheerfully agreed to for an undertaking
so important.</p>

<p>Several pilot boats cruise about the river Plate, from
which pilots may be obtained.</p>

<p>In addition to the difficulty of large vessels getting up
the river, an adequate freight cannot be procured for them
in Buenos Ayres. The Lord Lynedoch, a ship of 550 tons,
with a numerous crew of Lascars, remained sixteen months
and at last took a cargo of mules to the Isle of France.
Vessels of 150 to 200 tons burthen are the most likely to
get employed.</p>

<p>Vessels discharge and take in their cargoes by means of
lighters, called <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">balandras</i>. An English gentleman, Mr. Cope,
has several in his employ, and does the chief part of the
English and American business. Should there be the least
swell upon the water, these lighters cannot lie alongside;
it is only in fine weather that work can be performed.</p>

<p>Boat-hire is dear: to the outer roads, 8 dollars 4 reals,
to the inner, in proportion. The boatmen are mostly Englishmen,
strong, active fellows.</p>

<p>The landing-place, at what was once the mole, is very
bad; heavy boats cannot get near. Carts are used to embark
and disembark, for which there is no fixed charge;
they get what they can, like our watermen at home. Those
whose business leads them often afloat, find it a great tax,
and some prefer riding on the backs of their sailors, to paying
it. It is seldom there is water sufficient for boats to
come close in, and they are at all times liable to damage,
from the pieces of rock, wrecks, &amp;c. near the shore.</p>

<p>Buenos Ayres, at the present period, may be said not to
possess a navy; neither, indeed, is so expensive an establishment
necessary. The captain of the port, Don Batista
Azopardo, is an Italian by birth; he is said to be a well-meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">-&nbsp;6&nbsp;-</a></span>
man. He commanded an armed vessel in the last
war, and has been once or twice a prisoner to the English.
There are likewise a number of marine officers in the
service of Buenos Ayres. The <i>Aranzazu</i>, national brig of
war, so long anchored in the outer roads, has a crew chiefly
English; some of them are refractory seamen from the
merchant vessels. The marines are black soldiers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are three regular packets which run between
Buenos Ayres and Monte Video; the <i>Pepa</i>, <i>Dolores</i>, and
<i>Mosca</i>, schooners. Seventeen dollars are charged for the
passage each way, every thing being provided, except beds.
This passage, which is about 150 miles, is sometimes made
in 12 or 14 hours; at others, it takes several days. The
favourite packet is the <i>Pepa</i>, an American-built schooner,
with good accommodations, commanded by Campbell, an
Englishman, who, from his skill and attention, is peculiarly
fitted for such an employment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <small>CLIMATE</small> of Buenos Ayres, taken generally, is decidedly
good, and more congenial to English habits than that
most places abroad. Its salubrity, however, is overrated:
a consumptive person must not think of coming here; many
of that class have been obliged to fly to Mendoza and other
climes, to escape the vicisitudes of this.</p>

<p>The spring months of September, October, November,
and the autumn ones of April and May, are the most
agreeable parts of the year. The thermometer, at those
seasons, averages about 60; and we have repeated clear
and bracing weather, intermingled, however, with inclement
days.</p>

<p>The summer is not so hot as the latitude would denote.
A sea breeze sets in, at times, towards the afternoon; but
this is not regular. December and January are the hottest
months. On some days of oppressive heat, the thermometer
may average 80, and at others, the pleasing temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">-&nbsp;7&nbsp;-</a></span>
of 70 and 75. In January, 1824, for nearly a week it
was 96 in the shade: the oldest inhabitant never remembered
such a continuance of heat. When the heat is at
the greatest, a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pampero</i> suddenly comes, with its accompaniment
of rain, thunder and lightning, and cools the air. These
Pampero winds from the W. and W.S.W. with nothing to
impede their progress across the extended Pampas, blow
with great violence, raising clouds of dust, and obliging
every one to close windows and doors. Being off the
land, they are not dangerous to shipping; though vessels
at the mouth of the river have been blown in sea hundreds
of miles, by a Pampero. The thunder and lightning
to an European is terrific: the lightning is often dangerous.</p>

<p>The dust, fleas, and musquitos, render the summer
months very disagreeable. The fleas are a great annoyance,
the houses being filled with them; the very dust breeds
them; and they seem to have a great partiality for foreigners.
I don&rsquo;t observe that the natives heed them. They laugh at
the English mode of washing the rooms to get rid of these
vermin; their plan is, to strew the room with fennel,
sweeping that and the fleas altogether into the street.
Musquitos are another of the disagreeables.</p>

<p>A north wind, in summer, is very unpleasant, the heated
atmosphere relaxing both mind and body. The combined
effects of heat, dust, and wind, make the enjoyment of an
evening promenade extremely precarious.</p>

<p>In summer, the pastures frequently catch fire, from the
intenseness of the heat. In 1821, Mr. Halsey, an American
gentleman, who has a large sheep farm, sustained a
considerable loss by an event of this kind, many of his
sheep having been burnt. The same heat that occasioned
Mr. Halsey&rsquo;s loss brought on a violent Pampero; and,
from the dust and burning ashes that enveloped the city,
one might have supposed that the days of Herculaneum
and Pompeii were about to return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">-&nbsp;8&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The winter is mild, yet there are days of piercing cold in
the months of June, July, and August; and thin ice may
be seen in the morning, but not any snow. We have here
the penetrating rains, mists, and November days of England,
without its comforts: from these circumstances, and
the heat of the summer, Englishmen feel the cold much
more than in England, and cling to their fire-sides, for
they have introduced those luxuries, and the natives in
some cases follow our example; otherwise, the ladies wrap
themselves up in their shawls, and the gentlemen in their
capotes, and thus pass the severe days of winter. The
thermometer in winter is generally at 40 to 50, sometimes
at 35.</p>

<p>The roads, after heavy rains, are nearly impassable,
forming <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pantanas</i>, or mud holes, which are dangerous to
travellers; but, on the return of fine weather; they quickly
dry again. The dead horses and dogs, that lie about the
roads, quickly decay.</p>

<p>The rich pastures afford food to the cattle all the year
round. The winter&rsquo;s general mildness prevents the necessity
of housing them.</p>

<p>That Buenos Ayres possesses a fine climate, no one can
deny; but not to the extent its panegyrists have stated. I
speak as I have found it, having in vain looked for that
Italian sky, soul-breathing softness in the air, that some
pretend to have found: but it may be defined a healthy,
warm climate.</p>

<p>The various and sudden changes to which the British
climate is subject, form a fruitful grumbling topic to many
Englishmen and foreigners, who can fancy nothing that is
not foreign. According to their accounts, even the moon
shines better here than at home. I will venture to assert,
that we have in England more real fine days in May, June,
July, August, and September, than in the best months at
Buenos Ayres. Of our delightful summer evenings, they
have nothing to compare. To make any contrast of a winter,
in latitude 34, and that of 50, is out of the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">-&nbsp;9&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>In this part of South America, earthquakes are only
heard of; we dread not, here, the catastrophes of Peru,
Chili, and Mexico.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The prevalent <small>DISEASES</small> of Buenos Ayres are fevers, sore
throats, rheumatism, and others common to Europe.
Strangers are subject to rheumatism from the dampness
and searching winds. Sore throats, in many instances, have
been fatal.</p>

<p>It has often been observed, that we feel the effects of
free-drinking here, more than in England. I have experienced
this more than once, and thought it peculiar to
myself, till others complained of the same.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The country round Buenos Ayres is uninteresting; all is
dreary sameness. But where, indeed, shall we find the
charming scenery of our dear England,&mdash;its hills and dales,
parks, thick-set hedges, and splendid mansions? We miss,
too, that endless chirping of birds, ever heard in our thick-set
hedges. Here, the equestrian takes his ride merely for
the sake of exercise, and not from any pleasure the country
can afford. I did not expect to find villas, parks, and
cultivated grounds; but I thought it would be more diversified.</p>

<p>In a place where horses are so cheap, one might conclude
that Englishmen would be continually on horseback,
but they soon get tired of a recreation, in which nothing
but exercise is concerned. The most frequented ride is to
the village of Isidro, fifteen miles from the city, the Richmond
of this place. On Sundays and holidays much company
resort thither. It has some attractions in point of
scenery.</p>

<p>The Barracca road is good&mdash;upon a par with those of
England. Horse-racing and other sports are practised
there, both by Englishmen and natives.</p>

<p>A ride in the neighbourhood of Buenos Ayres is not, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">-&nbsp;10&nbsp;-</a></span>
entirely devoid of interest; especially in the fruit season,
when the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quintas</i>, or farm-houses, with the peach trees
weighed down by delicious fruit, the orange trees (though
this is not their soil), and the wild aloe, so common in this
and the opposite continent of Africa, afford an agreeable
prospect. But the wild rose, blackberries, and the mass of
roots and plants of English fields and hedges, are not to be
seen. The trees (if they can be called so) are of a nature so
dwarfish, that they seem like apologies for trees, stinted
in their growth by bad nursing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Alameda</i>, or public walk of Buenos Ayres, is upon
the beach, near the mole. It is totally unworthy such a
city, and in the neighbourhood of all the rabble of the
town. It is only about 200 yards in length, with rows of
trees the height of bushes on each side, and brick seats,
which are too much honoured by the fair forms that use
them. A moderate assemblage frequent this walk on
Sunday evenings: the beauty and dress of the females
could alone tempt a stranger to visit it. On other days it
is deserted, except by some elderly gentlemen, who, as in
our St. James&rsquo;s Park and Kensington Gardens, are glad to
escape from the multitude, and commune with themselves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The beach well deserves its nick-name of <i>Wapping</i>;
being crowded with sailors of all nations, grog-shops, stores,
&amp;c. The English sailors idling about the beach would man
a ship of war. A stranger, seeing so many English faces,
might suppose it an English colony. At night, the
sailors in the grog-shops dance, to the music of the fiddle
and flute, reels, and the College hornpipe in perfection,
astonishing the Spanish girls. At one of these <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pulperias</i>,
or grog-shops, on the beach, a large picture was lately
hoisted, of H.M.S. Boyne in full sail, flags, signals, &amp;c.
streaming. The English sailors mustered in great numbers
upon this occasion, and rent the air with their cheers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">-&nbsp;11&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The seamen upon the beach are, at times, disorderly;
but not more so than in other countries. American sailors
have been the most refractory, causing their captains infinite
trouble. The captain of an American ship going to
sea, lately, made application to the captain of one of our
packets, for irons, to punish his mutinous crew; but he replied,
that he never had such articles on board his ship.</p>

<p>In no part of the world are masters of vessels subject to
such annoyance from the desertion of their crews.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Men get
into the hands of crimps, who conceal them, and exact their
own price from those who are in want of sailors. This has
been in some measure rectified lately, especially since the
suppression of privateering. Many sailors roam about the
country, working as labourers; but they soon get tired of
that, and hanker after their old employment, as an old coachman
likes to hear the smack of the whip. These &ldquo;beach-rangers,&rdquo;
as they are called, have often wished to enter for
his majesty&rsquo;s ships that have been lying off Buenos Ayres;
but few or none have been accepted. <a id="Sailors">Sailors</a> begin to find
there is no service equal to our&rsquo;s.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are two English <small>COFFEE-HOUSES</small>, or <small>HOTELS</small>;
Faunch&rsquo;s, and Keen&rsquo;s. The former is a very superior one,
and provides the dinners given upon our national days,
such as St. George&rsquo;s, St. Andrew&rsquo;s, &amp;c. besides numerous
private dinners of Englishmen, Americans, Creolians, &amp;c.
It is situated near the Fort. Faunch, the master, and his
wife, have had great experience in their profession in London;
and the style of his dinners is hardly to be exceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">-&nbsp;12&nbsp;-</a></span>
there. The king&rsquo;s birth-day dinner is kept up with great
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&eacute;clat</i>: the room is surrounded by flags of different nations;
and they have both vocal and instrumental music. From
70 to 80 persons generally sit down to table, including the
ministers of the country, who are always invited. The government
pay us the compliment of hoisting the flag at the
Fort, on that day.</p>

<p>Another hotel, kept by a respectable North-American
female, Mrs. Thorn, a widow, is much resorted to by the
Americans.</p>

<p>In the above coffee-houses, they charge 40 dollars per
month for board and lodging. An abatement is made to
those who agree to remain a certain period. Dinner for
one person, including a pint of wine, is a dollar; breakfast,
tea, and supper, from 2 to 4 reals each; and a bed per
night, 4 reals.</p>

<p>On the beach, near the Fort, is a tavern, or eating-house,
called the Commercial Hotel; the master of which is a
Spaniard, but most of the waiters and servants are French:
they have, likewise, an English waiter. Dishes of all
sorts can be procured there. To dine well, the price
amounts to nearly the same as at other taverns. The large
dining-room will accommodate from 70 to 80 persons, and
is neatly fitted up. Pictures of the battle of Alexandria,
the storming of Seringapatam; portraits of the French
Marshals, Bertrand, Drouet, Foy, &amp;c.; and views of Paris
and other cities, are suspended round the room.</p>

<p>The Caf&eacute; de la Victoria, in Buenos Ayres, is very splendid;
we have nothing of the sort in London. It may not
perhaps vie with the Mille Colonnes, or other Parisian
coffee-houses. There are, likewise, in Buenos Ayres, those
of St. Marco, the Catalan, and Caf&eacute; de Martin. They have
all large court-yards, or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patios</i>, attached to them, and
stand upon a great space of ground, more than could be
well spared in London for such purposes, where land is
so valuable. These <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patios</i>, in summer, are covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">-&nbsp;13&nbsp;-</a></span>
awnings, affording an agreeable retreat from the sun&rsquo;s heat.
They have wells of good water. To each also is attached
a billiard table; and, as this is a pastime to which they are
much addicted, the tables are always crowded. The coffee-rooms
are covered with shewy French paper, representing
scenes in India, Otaheite, Don Quixote, and designs from
Grecian and Roman history.</p>

<p>A new coffee-house was opened in December, 1824, near
the church of St. Michael. The music, illuminations, and
fireworks, in front of the establishment, on the evening of
its opening, attracted a great concourse of people.</p>

<p>About four miles from town is a public-house called
the York Hotel, kept by a native. Creolian masters and
mates of vessels, upon their hired horses, at one dollar per
afternoon, generally stop there; and the horses are so accustomed
to it, that it is with difficulty they will go beyond
it.</p>

<p>In the coffee-houses the charges are very moderate: a
wine-glass of liqueurs, brandy, or any other cordial, tea,
coffee, and bread, half a real; with toast, one real. The
waiters do not expect fees, as in England: a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">capitas</i>, or
head waiter, superintends the coffee-room.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In the arrangements and decoration of coffee-houses, the
French and Spaniards far outstrip us. The English are not
a coffee-house-going people: that time which other nations
spend in them, the Englishman passes in business, or with
his family.</p>

<p>Many Englishmen, upon their first arrival, reside with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">-&nbsp;14&nbsp;-</a></span>
Spanish families, to improve themselves in the language:
forty dollars per month is the charge. The houses of
Mrs. Cassamajor and Mrs. Rubio take in boarders; these
families are of the highest respectability, and they have
several accomplished daughters, whose society is very interesting;
but Spanish cookery, with its garlic and grease,
no more pleases an English taste, than does that of the
French.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of the <span class="smcap">Public Buildings</span>, the Fort is the seat of government,
the Downing-Street of Buenos Ayres: it is situated
near the river, with residences inside. Though surrounded
by a ditch, with cannon mounted on the ramparts, drawbridges,
&amp;c. it could make but little defence against a serious
attack. One would suppose, that those who chose the spot
on which the city is built, had in view the prevention of attack
by hostile fleets, the shallowness of the water being
a defence against any danger of this kind.</p>

<p>The Consulado is a respectable-looking house; it contains
a Court of Justice, or Appeals, for persons cited for
debt, of which they regulate the payment according to the
ability of the party summoned, very similar to our Courts
of Request. In cases of debt they are very lenient, seldom
committing to prison, except for a flagrant attempt at fraud,
and sometimes giving the debtor five years to pay his creditors,
which is almost tantamount to a release. Disputes are
decided by the magistrates, at the Consulado, with an impartiality
that gives universal satisfaction. The English disputants,
it has been observed, are very numerous, causing
more trouble than those of all the rest of the town put together.
The Post-Office is held in this building; and on
the first floor (for the house is one story high) is a Music
School, in the morning for young ladies, and in the evening
for gentlemen.</p>

<p>The Cabildo, or Town-House, has nothing remarkable
about it, but the church tower, and a long balcony in front:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">-&nbsp;15&nbsp;-</a></span>
it is built in the Plaza, of which it forms the western boundary.
The great powers possessed by the Members of the
Cabildo, according to the old Spanish law, have been reformed
within these three years. It has a prison for criminal
offenders; and the head Police-Office is near it.</p>

<p>The Bank, and the adjoining range of houses, are lofty
and handsome.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives has been lately constructed;
it follows the model, on a minor scale, of the
French Chamber at Paris, and forms a perfect theatre.
The members are seated in the pit, the president and secretary
on the stage, and the spectators in the boxes. A bell
announces the commencement and the close of business.
The orators, when speaking, remain seated; so that they
have no opportunity to display the graces of action. It is
well lighted, by tasteful chandeliers. The armed soldiery,
both inside and outside the house, destroys the idea of republicanism.</p>

<p>The Custom-House has no pretensions to notice, on
the score of appearance, whatever it may merit for its
convenience. It was proposed to build another, in the extensive
grounds and gardens of the suppressed monastery
of Le Merced; but this, like many other propositions, has
been abandoned.</p>

<p>The Public Library is a credit to this infant state; it
contains about 21,000 volumes. Every respectable person
is allowed admittance, to peruse the books. Mr. Moreno,
who speaks English, is the librarian. Some choice drawings
of medals from France are in the library.</p>

<p>There is a small Botanical Museum; but the country
furnishes few specimens of plants.</p>

<p>The Retiro, occupied as barracks, is on the north extremity
of the city, and has nothing worthy of notice about it,
but its theatrical appearance, and daubs of paintings on
the walls. There is a large space in front, called the Bull
Ring, in which bull-fights used to take place. The band<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">-&nbsp;16&nbsp;-</a></span>
performs there, for a short time, in the afternoon. It is
here that criminals are shot, when the punishment is not for
a state offence. Being situated upon high ground, and
near the river, the Retiro has a pleasant prospect. In one
of the streets near it, is a large brick building, built for a
distillery, twelve years since, by Mr. Thwaites, an Englishman.
The speculation did not answer, and the house is
now in a state of dilapidation. A windmill, west of the
town, is a conspicuous object; it is the only one in the
country, and was erected by Mr. Stroud, also an Englishman.
It had, for some time, the fate of the distillery; but
I have heard that it now flourishes.</p>

<p>The Residencia, on the south side of the Fort, is appropriated
as an hospital. There are two or three other public
hospitals, including one for foundlings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Grand Plaza is a large square, environed by buildings:
on the east is the Recoba, a piazza with shops;
on the west, the Cabildo; on the north, a part of the
cathedral; and on the south, a range of shops. There is a
pyramid in the centre, which, on festival nights, is illuminated.
If paved, it would be an admirable place for the
parade of troops; at present, wet weather renders it almost
impassable.</p>

<p>A second Plaza has been made, adjoining the other, near
the Fort, by the removal of the market-place and some dirty
sheds and stabling.</p>

<p>The river, the fort, some neat buildings on the south,
the handsome arch, under which there is a passage to the
two plazas, the towers of St. Francisco&rsquo;s church, and the
Cabildo, taken in perspective from Faunch&rsquo;s Hotel, would
form a good picture.</p>

<p>At night, the streets are respectably lighted by lamps
fastened to the walls, which extend as far as the eye can
reach in some of the principal thoroughfares, in St. Francisco
Street particularly. A stranger, on viewing this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">-&nbsp;17&nbsp;-</a></span>
street, would imbibe no mean opinion of the city. The
lamps do not afford any thing like the illumination of the
gas lights of London; they are equal, however, to those
used before the introduction of gas.</p>

<p>From the state of the pavements, except in the principal
streets, walking at night is very disagreeable&mdash;in wet weather,
dangerous; and here are no accommodating hackney
coaches to jump into.</p>

<p>It is intended to pave all the streets; but, from the
scarcity of workmen and materials, it will be some time
before this can be effected. Those that have pavements,
bating their narrowness, are similar to the streets of London;
the unpaved ones are very miserable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <small>HOUSES</small> of Buenos Ayres are mostly built of brick, and
white-washed. Very few of them are one story high: they
are flat-roofed, with a high parapet, and have a court-yard
attached. The windows are protected by iron bars placed
lengthwise in the front, so that a Londoner might fancy
them lock-up houses. They form a complete fortification;
and the loss sustained in Whitelock&rsquo;s attack ceases to excite
surprise, recollecting that our troops had to run the
gauntlet through an enemy they could not get at.</p>

<p>Many of the houses occupy a large extent of ground.
The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sala</i> is the principal room. The roofs of the houses,
denominated the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">azotea</i>, are very pleasant, especially near
the river; and the party-walls are so low, that a person can
traverse whole streets upon the house-tops. The inhabitants
do not fear robberies, relying upon the strength of their
doors, iron-barred windows, and barking dogs: of the latter,
two or three are in a house. The bars in the window fronts
are an excellent contrivance, and quite necessary, in a climate
requiring so much air, and likewise for security, the
street windows being close to the foot-path, and no areas to
protect them. They report that this fashion is a remnant of
Spanish jealousy; at any rate, it does their invention credit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">-&nbsp;18&nbsp;-</a></span>
Many of the mansions are specimens of Moorish architecture;
those belonging to the richer class are splendidly
furnished with carpets, handsome mirrors, &amp;c. So little
wood is used in building, there is no fear of fire. Extensive
houses, formerly occupied by the first families of
the country, are now tenanted by British merchants; and
the salas that were once graced by beauty, music, and the
dance, are now stored with dry goods, and nothing is heard
but the hum of business.</p>

<p>House rent is very high: for a moderate-sized house,
from 60 to 80 dollars per month.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Churches</span>.&mdash;In Catholic countries, the attention of
the Protestant traveller is ever attracted towards the
churches. Their gorgeous decorations, music, dress of the
priesthood, &amp;c. form so great a contrast to the simplicity
of the reformed religion, that we gaze, as if viewing the
splendid scenery of some theatrical spectacle, and, for the
moment, cease to be astonished at the influence which this
imposing church has exercised, and still continues to exercise,
over a great portion of the Christian world. If the
Spaniards in Europe are supposed to surpass all other
Catholic nations in their strict adherence to the rights and
ceremonies of &ldquo;holy church,&rdquo; they have not neglected to
transplant to South America this formidable engine of
power. The charms of its music, and its general magnificence,
must have bewildered the imagination of the natives,
and insured to the Spaniards complete authority.</p>

<p>I have visited most of the churches of Buenos Ayres,
with feelings I can scarcely describe. My mind was ever
strongly imbued with recollections of those youthful readings
of monastic institutions, of cowled monks and nuns,
which, in our Protestant land, we only read of; but to have
the reality before me, absorbed every faculty&mdash;I gave a
loose to fancy&mdash;every thought was engaged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">-&nbsp;19&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>I believe the following to be a tolerably correct list of
the churches and chapels in Buenos Ayres:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Cathedral.</li>
  <li>St. Francisco.</li>
  <li>St. Domingo.</li>
  <li>St. Ignatio, or College Church.</li>
  <li>St. Catalina (Convent of Nuns).</li>
  <li>St. Juan &emsp; (ditto).</li>
  <li>St. Nicholas.</li>
  <li>St. Miguel.</li>
  <li>Residencia.</li>
  <li>Montserrat.</li>
  <li>La Merced.</li>
  <li>La Conception.</li>
  <li>Loccaro.</li>
  <li>Recolator.</li>
  <li>La Piedad.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
  <li> &emsp; <i>Chapels.</i></li>
  <li>St. Lucia.</li>
  <li>St. Roque.</li>
  <li>Hospital.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Cathedral is a large domed building, built of brick,
as indeed they all are. Its outside presents nothing particular,
with the exception of its loftiness; and, in common
with the rest, it has crosses placed upon every prominent
part. A new front is building towards the Plaza; but it
gets on very slowly, the scaffolding being so very expensive.
The interior is lofty and spacious; it is ornamented
with figures of the Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus, in
glittering attire. Jesus on the cross, and saints in strict
costume, occupy places at the different altars. Flowers,
artificial and real, are plentifully bestowed, and relics are
strewed in all directions, informing the foreigner that
he is in a land where Catholicism once existed in all its
pristine grandeur. These emblems of peace, in the body
of the church, are shaded by those of war from above. Suspended
from the ceiling are about twenty flags, taken from
the Spaniards on various occasions, as at Monte Video,
Maypu, &amp;c. <i>Fernando VII.</i> is inscribed upon most of
them. The grand altar is adorned with costly gems; and
when the large and numerous candles are lighted, the effect
is grand. The organ and choir are good: the tones of
the former vibrating through the aisles, and the kneeling
females in black attire, make an impression of no ordinary
nature. The government and municipal authorities attend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">-&nbsp;20&nbsp;-</a></span>
at the Cathedral on state and feast days, forming processions
to and from the church. The Sunday mass, about
twelve o&rsquo;clock, is attended by most of the fashion and beauty
of the town.</p>

<p>Of the churches, that of St. Francisco seems most profusely
ornamented. Virgins and saints of all descriptions
occupy every altar and nook of the interior, clothed in
rich and fanciful attire, which the devotion of the faithful
has bestowed. The grand altar is very brilliant; and
when fully lighted, it appears a sheet of gold. Some of
the ornaments, I should think, are valuable. This edifice
is of considerable length, and contains twenty friars of the
order of St. Francisco, the only community of the sort
now existing in Buenos Ayres. The towers are paved with
tiling, which, at a distance, looks like marble. St. Francisco&rsquo;s
church is my favourite, for, child-like, I am attracted
by glitter.</p>

<p>The College church is one I rarely visit, from prejudice
or revenge at an insult offered to me by one of the servants,
who told me Englishmen had no business there, and
absolutely took my arm to conduct me out. In any other
place I should have chastised him.&mdash;It is a gloomy structure,
both outside and inside, even with the usual decorations.
The Holy Ghost proceeds on its different missions
from this church.</p>

<p>St. Domingo church is large, with a spacious dome. It
had, until the suppression, in 1822, forty-eight friars of
the <a id="Dominican">Dominican</a> order; amongst whom was an Irish priest,
Father Burke, who, from motives of kindness, is still allowed
to occupy his apartment. He is more than 70 years
of age, and much esteemed by the British as well as natives,
being divested of those prejudices which so often disgrace
his cloth. The rooms of the friars, and the garden, make
it a comfortable retreat. The interior of St. Domingo is
light and airy, without much decoration; but it contains
objects that swell the beating hearts of Englishmen&mdash;British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">-&nbsp;21&nbsp;-</a></span>
standards ranged around the dome, the trophies of Beresford&rsquo;s
and Whitelock&rsquo;s expeditions. Crawford, with part
of his division, it will be recollected, took refuge in this
church. I have viewed those flags with the most painful recollections,
obtained, as they were, not in open fight, but by
concealed and inaccessible enemies; and have felt for the
fate of my unhappy countrymen, slaughtered, without an
opportunity to retaliate, by those who could not have stood
one half-hour before them in a fair field of battle. This
city is almost the only one in the world that can boast the
possession of such prizes.</p>

<p>The church of Le Merced is a very pretty building,
with a dome and tower. The interior is compact, and, in
splendour, very little inferior to St. Francisco; containing
virgins, Madonas, holy pictures, &amp;c. &amp;c. in gorgeous abundance,
with the usual quantity of confessional boxes. It is
much resorted to. Until lately, it held forty-five friars, of
the order of Le Merced; a peculiar order, allowing its
professors, it is said, to wear concealed arms. One of the
regiments attends divine service, and their band performs,
in this church.</p>

<p>The description of one may be said to include a description
of all the churches, as they partake of the same general
character, excepting only that some are more splendid
than others. No impediment is offered to the admission
of foreigners into these sacred buildings; and they may
roam about <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</i>. The obstruction I received in the
College church, I am persuaded, was the unauthorized act
of the fellow who offered it. To avoid singularity, it is
best to conform to their mode of devotion. The eye of
curiosity will, now and then, be directed towards a stranger;
but this is to be expected, though some gentlemen express
a repugnance to visit their churches for that reason, and a
fear of intruding.</p>

<p>The churches, with the buildings attached, gardens, &amp;c.
occupy a great extent of ground; particularly those of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">-&nbsp;22&nbsp;-</a></span>
Juan and Catalina, which were erected at a time when religious
enthusiasm was at its height.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <span class="smcap">Theatre</span>, as an edifice, has nothing to boast. The
exterior looks like a stable; but the interior is better than
the outside promises. It has been much improved since
my arrival. They sadly want a new theatre. There is a
plot of ground near the Plaza just adapted for it: but unless
the government take it in hand, the public spirit of
individuals, I fear, will not; and yet, with a people so theatrically
inclined, it is somewhat surprising. Almost the
first inquiry of a foreigner is of the Theatre: at present,
they smile at its insignificance.</p>

<p>The pit is large, extending a considerable length from
the stage, with backs to the seats, and partitions to each,
which serve as a rest for the arms: they are numbered,
and let out under the appellation of &ldquo;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">lunetas</i>;&rdquo; every person
proceeding to his own seat; thus the crowding and fighting,
for places, so common in our theatres, is avoided. No
females are admitted into the pit.</p>

<p>In the dress circle, some blue silk spread over the panels
of the boxes is all that distinguishes it from the others.</p>

<p>The dress boxes will contain about eight persons each.
As they have not any seats affixed to them, those who
engage them send chairs; or the theatre will supply
them, by paying a trifle for their use. The price of a box,
for a night&rsquo;s performance, is three dollars. These boxes,
and, indeed, places for every other part of the house, may
be taken for a certain period called a &ldquo;<i>function</i>,&rdquo; which
lasts ten nights. Many families engage their boxes this
way, which makes them come reasonable.</p>

<p>Under the dress circle, and even with the pit, are boxes
called <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">palcos</i>, at 2&frac12; dollars per night.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cazuela</i>, or gallery, is similar to the one at Astley&rsquo;s,
except that it is not so large. It is appropriated to females
alone. The keeping females thus crowded together in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">-&nbsp;23&nbsp;-</a></span>
a theatre, and separated from their natural protectors,
seems an abominable practice. A stranger is apt to form
erroneous opinions of the fair occupants of the cazuela, and
can scarcely believe that the most respectable are to be
found there: but it is so; and husbands, brothers, and
friends, wait for them at the gallery door. This custom, it
is said, they inherit from the Moors. The <em>goddesses</em> of the
cazuela behave in the most orderly manner; much more so,
I suspect, than my countrywomen would, similarly situated.</p>

<p>Over the stage is inscribed the words&mdash;&ldquo;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Es la Comedia
Espejo de la Vida</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Governor&rsquo;s box was close to the stage, on what in
the London theatres is denominated the Prince&rsquo;s side of
the house; and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cabildo</i>, or box of the chief magistracy,
was in front. But now the Governor&rsquo;s box is removed
to what was the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cabildo</i>, and the English consul
occupies the one lately the Governor&rsquo;s. The Governor,
except on national days, seldom attends the theatre.</p>

<p>That important personage, the prompter, has his little tub,
as usual, in the middle of the stage, destroying all the illusion
of the scene, and, from necessity, obliging the audience to
hear him as well as the performers. Senor Zappucci, an
Italian, intent, one evening, upon impressing the audience
with the drollery of a comic song, fell through the prompter&rsquo;s
hole; and the spectators began to consider whether
this was a part of his song. Fortunately he was not hurt.
The superior arrangement, in this respect, of the English
theatres, might afford a lesson to the most prejudiced
foreigners.</p>

<p>The admittance is two reals to all parts of the house: but
this does not include a seat. It is, therefore, necessary to
take a whole box, or a single place in the pit (which costs
three reals), in addition to the admission.</p>

<p>Soldiers, who constitute every where the police of the
city, were formerly stationed both inside and outside of the
theatre; but this is no longer the case; and the eye of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">-&nbsp;24&nbsp;-</a></span>
the republican citizen is not offended by their presence
at places of public amusement.</p>

<p>No refreshments are sold in the theatre; we never hear
the &ldquo;Choice fruit, ladies and gentlemen, and a bill of the
play!&rdquo; and the spectators in the pit are saved the nuisance
of having the peelings of oranges and apples dropped upon
them. But then they are not condemned to sit five or six
hours, as in our theatres; three hours and a half is the utmost.
The pit audience generally walk out between the acts,
and reassume their seats without disturbance or difficulty.</p>

<p>Smoking in the theatre is not allowed; but such charms
has the segar, that they watch the opportunity of the absence
of the police to smoke in the lobbies.</p>

<p>The theatre continues open all the year round, with the
exception of Lent; and then music is permitted.</p>

<p>The regular nights of performance are Sundays and
Thursdays; though there are sometimes performances on
Tuesdays, saints&rsquo; days, &amp;c. Sunday nights are the most
crowded, as in all Catholic countries. On rainy nights there
is no performance.</p>

<p>The usual performances at the theatre consist of a play
and farce; with singing, sometimes, between the acts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<cite>Othello</cite>&rdquo; is at times performed&mdash;not that of our Shakspeare,
but a translation from the French. Its absurdities
and tameness no Englishman can endure with common
patience; he looks in vain for those bursts that overpower
the imagination, and electrify the spectators.</p>

<p>An ingenious English gentleman translated Cumberland&rsquo;s
&ldquo;<cite>Wheel of Fortune</cite>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<cite>The Jew</cite>;&rdquo; but they are
too sentimental to please this audience. &ldquo;<cite>Love laughs at
Locksmiths</cite>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<cite>Matrimony</cite>,&rdquo; from the original French,
are stock pieces; and &ldquo;<cite>The Scottish Outlaw</cite>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<cite>Charles
Edward Stuart</cite>&rdquo; are very successful.</p>

<p>The performers are about equal to those of our country
theatres. Of the females, Do&ntilde;a Trinidad Guevra takes the
lead. She has a good figure, a tolerably expressive face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">-&nbsp;25&nbsp;-</a></span>
and a sweet, plaintive voice. In such parts as <i>Letitia Hardy</i>,
and <i>Maria</i>, in &ldquo;<cite>The Citizen</cite>,&rdquo; she excels; and likewise in
the sentimental.</p>

<p>Velarde is their first male performer, and plays tragedy,
comedy, farce&mdash;it would be unkind to say, with <i>Silvester
Daggerwood</i>&mdash;and &ldquo;makes nothing of them;&rdquo; for, in
comedy, he has talent: his tragedy is not first-rate. He
has the merit of dressing his characters with some regard
to costume. I have seen him personate a British officer,
with a uniform coat nearly a copy of those worn by our
Foot-Guard officers.&mdash;The general manner of dress upon
the stage, at times, approaches to the burlesque. An English
nobleman is always made to wear the order of the
Garter, and a star, whether in street, forest, or drawing-room.
Se&ntilde;or Rosquellas, in the part of <i>Lord Leicester</i> or
<i>Essex</i> (I know not which) in Rossini&rsquo;s &ldquo;<cite>Queen Elizabeth</cite>,&rdquo;
wears the dress of a modern French field-marshal: his
taste and experience should reform this.</p>

<p>Se&ntilde;or Culebras (in English, Mr. Snake) is made the butt
of the juvenile part of the audience&mdash;the <i>Claremont</i> of this
theatre. When he appears to give out the play, they vociferate
his name. Why they thus make sport of him, I
know not, except that he has a peculiarly spare person, and
is a sort of deputy manager, the Mr. Lamp of the company.
He is said to be a sensible man, speaking the Spanish
language very correctly. As an actor, he is both chaste
and pleasing.</p>

<p>In low comedy, they have a good actor, named Felipe
David, the Liston of the company; and one Se&ntilde;or Vera,
who is a useful performer, as well as singer, and has abilities
of no mean order. His representation of <i>Colonel Cox</i>,
in the play of &ldquo;<cite>Charles Edward Stuart</cite>,&rdquo; founded upon
an incident after the battle of Culloden, forcibly brought
to my recollection Lovegrove&rsquo;s <i>Rattan</i>, in the farce of
&ldquo;<cite>The Bee-Hive</cite>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our English actresses, when they come on the stage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">-&nbsp;26&nbsp;-</a></span>
&ldquo;prepared for woe,&rdquo; have their white pocket-handkerchiefs
pinned to their clothes: here they are held in the hands.
Both customs are ridiculous; and the constant application
they make of them in this theatre renders it more so.</p>

<p>The orchestra consists of twenty-eight instrumental performers.
The symphonies between the acts are from
Haydn, Mozart, &amp;c. &amp;c. as in the English theatres. The
performances are ushered in by an overture, generally selected
with great taste.</p>

<p>The musical department has greatly improved; and they
get through difficult compositions with considerable spirit:
constant practice, and, above all, the great exertions of
Se&ntilde;or Rosquellas has effected this. This gentleman, a
Spaniard by birth, made his first <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">deb&ucirc;t</i> before a Buenos
Ayres audience in 1822, as a vocalist. His science has
enabled him to surmount the imperfections of a very indifferent
voice, and he is always heard with pleasure.
Mr. Rosquellas<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> may be called the founder of the Buenos
Ayres Opera; for, until he came, the orchestra was very
indifferent. Mr. Rosquellas speaks English, and is married
to an English lady. He has been in London, and, I believe,
sung with Braham there. He was ably seconded by
Se&ntilde;or Vacani, also from Rio Janeiro, the best <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">buffo</i> I have
seen (Naldi, perhaps, excepted). We had the music of
Rossini night after night to delighted audiences: the duet of
&ldquo;<cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Al&rsquo; idea di quell metallo</cite>,&rdquo; from &ldquo;<cite>The Barber of Seville</cite>,&rdquo;
is as great a favourite here as in Europe.</p>

<p>The departure of Vacani left a blank in the musical
world, which has been since, in some degree, compensated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">-&nbsp;27&nbsp;-</a></span>
by the appearance of Do&ntilde;a Angelina Tani. She has a fine
tenor voice; the lower tones are of great depth, and some
of them she elicits with great effect in a trio from Rossini&rsquo;s
&ldquo;<cite>Elizabeth Queen of England</cite>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the Lent of 1824, we had some delightful musical
treats, which rendered the representations of their regular
drama very dull, particularly to a foreigner.</p>

<p>An English mechanic, by name Waldegrave, was tempted
to make a trial upon this stage as a singer. He sung &ldquo;<cite>The
Beautiful Maid</cite>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<cite>The Bewildered Maid</cite>;&rdquo; but he
failed to make any impression. His voice was good, but
he wanted grace.</p>

<p>In English singing, I doubt whether the inimitable Braham
would please them. They smile at the idea of our
having a talent for music. The finest compositions of
Arne, Storace, Shield, Braham, &amp;c. might stand a chance
of being suspected to be stolen from foreign composers; for
nothing goes down but Italian or Spanish music. Rosquellas,
from being a Spaniard, and singing their popular songs,
such as the &ldquo;<cite lang="es" xml:lang="es">Contrabandista</cite>,&rdquo; &amp;c. is just to their taste:
for, though no longer owning the Spanish sway, they still
cling to that music which charmed them in their youth.</p>

<p>With a people so fond of dancing, one would expect to
find a regular corps de ballet at the theatre; but a dance
was not to be seen, except, now and then, dancers from the
Rio Janeiro Theatre accepted engagements for a limited
period, until Monsieur and Madame Touissaint, from the
Paris and London Opera, arrived, who meet with great and
deserved encouragement.</p>

<p>The bolero, fandango, and the pleasing castanets, seem
peculiar only to Spain: I had thought to have found them
common here. The Touissaints have introduced the bolero,
and dance charmingly.</p>

<p>An Englishman, at a foreign theatre, cannot help being
struck with the stillness and order, which form so great a
contrast to what he has been accustomed to at home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">-&nbsp;28&nbsp;-</a></span>
The theatre of Buenos Ayres, in this respect, might
serve as an example to those of more polished nations.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
But, notwithstanding Lord Byron&rsquo;s remark, that he would
never write a play for our winter theatres, whilst
the one-shilling gallery was suffered to remain; I prefer
their boisterous mirth, and its many inconveniences, to the
monotony of the foreign stage. The magnificence and
ingenuity of our Christmas pantomime, which every body
pretends to despise, and yet which all go to see, with the
joyous faces of so many children seated round the boxes,
convulsed with laughter at the drolleries of a Grimaldi, are
not to be paralleled elsewhere. A London theatre is, indeed,
a world within itself.</p>

<p>Sometimes a straggling English sailor will wander into
this theatre; but not understanding it, he soon leaves it for
the grog shop. A sailor is always a troublesome inmate of
a theatre. Two of them were passing their remarks
rather loudly, one evening: the audience laughed; but not
so the police, for they handed the two poor fellows into the
street. Jack swore that he had had many a row at the
Liverpool and Portsmouth play-house, without being molested;
and damned such liberty as that at Buenos Ayres.
I got my weather-beaten countrymen away, seeing them
inclined to resist; for unarmed men stand but a poor chance
with a police of bayonets and swords.</p>

<p>Managers and actors quarrel in the new as well as in the
old world. Velarde has had one or two disputes, and left
the theatre. The audience insisted upon his return,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">-&nbsp;29&nbsp;-</a></span>
and the manager was obliged to yield. The actor&rsquo;s appearance,
after these squabbles, is made a triumph by his
friends; and the ladies in the cazuela throw bouquets, literally
strewing the stage with flowers. These disagreements
give rise to formal appeals to the public, from both
parties, in the shape of printed addresses. In Velarde&rsquo;s
dispute, the manager had charged him with getting drunk.
The actor indignantly denied this; but allowed that, on
the 25th of May (the anniversary of their independence),
he did get a little merry, broke glasses, and quarrelled with
the landlord, in honour of the day, as every good patriot
should do; and, in answer to a remark that had been made
upon the graces of his person, he stated, that he did not
possess Jacob&rsquo;s ladder, to climb to heaven, and ask God
why he was not made an Adonis.</p>

<p>A certain priest, Casta&ntilde;eda, having, in a publication, attacked
the character of Do&ntilde;a Trinidad, for wearing upon
the stage the portrait of a married gentleman (as he asserted),
the lady absented herself from the theatre for some
nights. On her re-appearance, she was greeted with applause;
the audience reasoning, like our&rsquo;s in the affair of
Mrs. H. Johnstone and Braham, that the public have
nothing to do with private character.</p>

<p>Performers, at times, in Buenos Ayres, announce their
own benefits&mdash;even the females. A lady will address the
audience with all the earnestness so important an occasion
demands, and will go round the house, delivering bills of
the intended performance, couched in high-flown language,
&ldquo;To the immortal and respectable public of Buenos
Ayres,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c. They know how to &ldquo;bill the town,&rdquo; as
well as any English country manager. Previous to a benefit
night, they have a custom of illuminating the front of
the theatre, and exhibiting a transparency of the proposed
representation;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> with bonfires, rockets, and a band of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">-&nbsp;30&nbsp;-</a></span>
music at the door. This has been ridiculed by one of the
newspapers, but it still continues in a degree.</p>

<p>The British are not great patrons to the theatre: they
assign, as a cause, the want of attraction; but business, and
their inclination to society among themselves, are perhaps
the chief reasons of their neglect. There are, however,
a number of Englishmen, who find relief from the cares of
business, and are constant attendants at the theatre; some
of them, without any fixed object, stroll about, earnestly
gazing at the pretty girls, whom they designate by particular
names. I have been much amused, when they have
pointed out to me the different ladies, under their fixed
appellations; as, Imogen, Euphrosyne, Discretion, Corinna,
Zenobia, the Greeks, &amp;c. One gentleman, Don Geronimo
Salas, they have named the King, from his great likeness
to George the Fourth of England. The resemblance is
considerable; only that Don Geronimo is not so corpulent
as his Majesty. It is not every day we see men with persons
so corpulent as his Britannic Majesty and Don Geronimo:
the former (national prejudice apart) does indeed
look like a king; the latter is a very handsome man.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon to see infants a few months old, in
the arms of their mothers, and slaves, at the play.</p>

<p>The ladies attend the boxes in their most brilliant attire,
combining neatness with elegance, mostly in white; the
neck and bosom partly exposed, just enough to excite admiration,
without alarming the most fastidious modesty;
a gold chain, or other ornament, is now and then suspended
from the neck; the dress, with short sleeves; the hair
tastefully arranged; a simple comb, and a few real or artificial
flowers braided about the hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">-&nbsp;31&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>On a full night, the theatre presents a spectacle of
lovely women, that a stranger would hardly expect. I
have often contemplated them, with their dark expressive
eyes and raven hair, adding, if possible, more beauty to
countenances already so beautiful.</p>

<p>I think no city in the world, of the same population,
can boast more charming females than Buenos Ayres.
Their appearance and brilliancy, at the theatre, is not exceeded
either at Paris or London; and I write from a tolerable
acquaintance with the theatres of both capitals. It
is true, the costly diamonds and waving plumes, that
blaze from the persons of the British and French fair, are
not to be seen in Buenos Ayres: those appendages, however,
in my humble opinion, add not to female loveliness.</p>

<p>The theatre was re-opened on the 16th January, 1825,
under the management of Messrs. Rosquellas and others,
after having been closed two months for the purpose of repairs
and alterations. Great improvements have been
made: the seats in the pit are covered with crimson velvet;
the whole interior of the house has been cleaned and
painted; the stage thrown more forward, and the orchestra
enlarged. A new drop-scene is exhibited, with the arms of
the country and other devices painted upon it; and, from
being better lighted, the theatre has now a neat appearance.</p>

<p>The operatic department constitutes the chief attraction
of the theatre: in this they have Rosquellas, Vacani (the
renowned <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">buffo</i>), the younger Vacani, Vera, the two Se&ntilde;oras
Tanis, and Do&ntilde;a Angelina Tani, who sings as exquisitely
as ever. Vacani, upon his re-appearance, after a
short absence, was hailed with shouts of approbation, and
bouquets of flowers thrown upon the stage.</p>

<p>In the dance, we have Touissaint, his wife, and a corps
de ballet, including some Portuguese comic dancers from
Rio Janeiro. Regular ballets of action now take place,
in lieu of the pas de deux, and pas seul, of one or two
principal dancers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">-&nbsp;32&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Under the old Spanish regime, the season of Lent was the
most gloomy part of the year; it is now the gayest: we have
operas and ballets two and three times a week, to delighted
audiences; selections from <cite>The Barber of Seville</cite>, <cite>Figaro</cite>,
<cite>Henry IV.</cite> &amp;c. the orchestra led by Masoni, the skilful
Masoni, whose talent draws forth raptures of applause.</p>

<p>It is in contemplation to get up regular operas, instead
of detached pieces: <cite>Don Giovanni</cite> has been mentioned&mdash;Rosquellas
to be the hero; he would both look and perform
it admirably, at least to those who have not seen Ambrogetti.</p>

<p>At the theatre door, on performance nights, several handsome
carriages are now to be seen, with lighted lamps
and well-dressed servants, belonging to English and other
families. When I arrived, in 1820, scarcely one was in existence.
Were a Spaniard to revisit this place, after an
absence of a few years, he would feel surprised at the alteration;
the rigid fasts of the church laid aside for innocent
enjoyments, the hum of business greeting his ear, and
European strangers every where meeting his eye. Old
Spain&rsquo;s ancient dominion of Buenos Ayres is gone for ever:
a few of the old school may yet cling to the mother country;
but the grand mass of the people, especially the younger
branches, are decidedly patriots.</p>

<p>An amateur performance took place, on the 21st February,
1825, for the benefit of the widows and orphans of
those who had fallen in the revolutionary wars. It was a
full house, and profitable&mdash;the reverse of Silvester Daggerwood&rsquo;s.
Orders are not admitted to the Buenos Ayres
theatre. The play was <cite>Virginius</cite>; and the different parts
were sustained by gentlemen of the city, in a style so creditable,
as to put to the blush the regular actors.</p>

<p>A North-American Frenchman, named Stanislaus, last
from the Havannah, has given several exhibitions at the
theatre upon galvanism, slight-of-hand, &amp;c. aided by machinery,
the best I have seen of the sort. His performance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">-&nbsp;33&nbsp;-</a></span>
was more than upon a par with our English professors.
The natives declared, he must have dealings with the devil;
or how could he transport handkerchiefs from the pockets
of individuals in the theatre to the lofty towers of the Cabildo,
in the Plaza? and this, they asserted, he had done.
Stanislaus was rewarded with good houses. His pronunciation
of the Spanish language excited bursts of laughter;
it was a mixture of Spanish, French, and English.</p>

<p>A Lecture on Astronomy was attempted; but it did not
meet with the success it merited, either from a want of taste
for this instructive science, or that the audience conceived
the theatre an improper place. The lecturer reading his
part, diminished the effect.</p>

<p>An Englishman (Bradley) has a <span class="smcap">Circus</span>, which is sometimes
open on Sunday afternoons, and on saints&rsquo; days.
Bradley is a decent horseman and clown; but he has to

<p><span class="smcap">British Residents</span>.&mdash;Before entering into a detail of
the manners and customs of the native or Spanish part of
the population, I shall take some notice of the various
<small>FOREIGNERS</small> who have become residents in this city.
Of these the most numerous are the <span class="smcap">English</span>: I have
heard, that the province of Buenos Ayres contains, of men,
women, and children, 3500 British individuals, according
to a census taken in 1822.</p>

<p>The British merchants are a respectable body in Buenos
Ayres: the commerce of the country is chiefly in their
hands; and, taking the clerks, servants, and others employed
in their barraccas, or hide warehouses, as well as in
their houses, the numbers are very imposing. Most houses
have a Spanish clerk, who (as well as his English brethren)
generally boards and lodges in the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">-&nbsp;34&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the above houses have their corresponding firms
at Rio Janeiro, Monte Video, Chili, and Peru, forming an
immense link, of no mean importance, to the trade of
Great Britain.</p>

<p>Our merchants, in Buenos Ayres, are not only land and
stock-holders; but, since the establishment of the Bank,
they have become Bank Directors. In thus identifying
themselves with the country, I am persuaded, they will not
forfeit one iota of their independence.</p>

<p>In 1821, the British merchants in Buenos Ayres advanced
to the Buenos Ayrean government a sum of money, by
way of loan, which was punctually repaid, contrary to the
expectations of many; for as this money was lent only a few
months after a revolution, when Ramirez and Carrera
were in the field, threatening the province, its return was
problematical.</p>

<p>The majority of the British merchants are natives of
Scotland, proverbial for their talent and activity in trade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">-&nbsp;35&nbsp;-</a></span>
Without being accused of undue partiality, I may safely
assert, that our merchants do honour to the country in
which they are domiciled. Quoting the language of Don
Valentin Gomez, at the King&rsquo;s birth-day dinner, of April 23,
1823, &ldquo;The English citizens have shewn themselves worthy
of the distinguished character they have acquired. In
Buenos Ayres, they have always been good fathers of families,
and good guests. The province owes them every
protection.&rdquo;<!--added &rdquo--></p>

<p>The clerks in the mercantile houses are kept pretty
closely to business, from eight in the morning till near
the same hour at night, holidays excepted, which is fagging
work.</p>

<p>Besides the merchants, there are a host of English shopkeepers.
The street of La Piedad is full of them; and
they retail almost every article that can be mentioned. In
all parts of the city, the eye continually meets with English,
and their inscriptions in front of the shops; as, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Zapatero
Ingles</i> (English Shoemaker), <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Sastre</i> (Tailor), <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carpenteria</i>
(Carpenter), <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Roloxero</i> (Watchmaker), &amp;c. &amp;c.; and the
quantity of British subjects dispersed all over the country,
as collectors of hides, agriculturists, &amp;c. is more than would
be believed.</p>

<p>A trifling jealousy is, at times, to be observed amongst
the natives, at the numbers of the English resident here;
the former supposing that we have a monopoly of business,
and drain the country of money. These false reasoners in
political economy cannot comprehend that, in trade, obligations
are mutual, and that for our goods we buy their
produce, often at a ruinous price. All increase of population
to a new and thinly-peopled country, like Buenos
Ayres, just released from a disgraceful thraldrom, ought to
be viewed as a benefit: the well informed know it to
be so.</p>

<p>The British medical practitioners at Buenos Ayres are&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">-&nbsp;36&nbsp;-</a></span>Drs.
Leper, Dick, Oughan,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Jenkinson, and Whitfield:
the two last are apothecaries. Drs. Leper and Dick are
surgeons in his majesty&rsquo;s navy, and are allowed to be men
of talent, and have good practice.</p>

<p>A physician here is not so profitable a concern as in
England: the guinea fee dwindles to a dollar per visit,
though to a favourite doctor they make presents. Once, in
London, I remember seeing thirty single guineas, for as
many visits, lying upon a doctor&rsquo;s table, the result of a
morning&rsquo;s work; and this was thought but little, to pay for
house expences, carriage, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A Medical Board has been formed here, which, a short
time since, examined into the qualifications of the different
medical men, propounding questions which, I am told,
would have puzzled Esculapius himself to answer. Two
unfortunate Irishmen were caught in the trap, and forbidden
to practise. Paddy, at no time, likes his talent to be depreciated:
accordingly, one of them took up the pen, and
wrote a long philippic; the other did not confine himself
to this, but made use of language, in the full senate of
medical sages, that consigned him to a dungeon for three
weeks, and he was afterwards banished the country. A
French doctor was suspended, for an error in the accouchement
of a lady.</p>

<p>There is a North-American doctor (Bond), and plenty
of native ones.</p>

<p>I should think this would be an excellent place for quack
doctors; indeed, they are beginning the trade already.
A medicine called <i>Panquimagoge</i>, invented by a man
named Le Roy, &ldquo;the immortal Le Roy,&rdquo; as the papers
stated, was puffed up, as being a certain cure for all complaints,
equalling the miracles of Prince Hohenlohe. He
who doubted the efficacy of <i>Panquimagoge</i>, was rated an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">-&nbsp;37&nbsp;-</a></span>
<em>ignoramus</em>. Its discoverer, it was added, had a statue of
gold erected to his memory in the Havannah. During this
infatuation, the medicine sold at an enormous price; but the
bubble soon burst: several persons became seriously ill,
and others absolutely lost their lives, by taking it. The
former enthusiasts looked quite &ldquo;chop-fallen.&rdquo; Strange
to say, several Englishmen were the dupes of this quackery;
indeed, the old and young, healthy and infirm, all took
<i>Panquimagoge</i>.</p>

<p>Several English have purchased <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">estancias</i>, or farms for
breeding of cattle; but, I fear, they will find some difficulty
in competing with the natives, who have every advantage
over them in this branch of commerce.</p>

<p>The British Commercial Subscription Room, in Buenos
Ayres, is a concern entirely British; and none but those
of that nation are, by the laws of the room, allowed to
subscribe. The present subscribers are about fifty-six;
and it is supported at a moderate expence. It has been
established since the year 1810, and affords not only a
relaxation, but a source of continual information. A constant
look-out is kept for vessels arriving and departing;
and entries are made of them, and sent home. By means
of excellent telescopes, national flags can be discerned at a
great distance. They have a constant supply of English
newspapers: the Courier, the Times, Morning Chronicle,
Bell&rsquo;s Messenger, Liverpool and other Gazettes, as well as
those of Buenos Ayres, Price Currents, Shipping List,
Quarterly Review, Edinburgh Review, Navy List, and
other publications. The room contains the best maps of
Arrowsmith, of the four quarters of the globe; charts of
the river Plate; a picture of Nelson&rsquo;s death, finely executed,
and another of the battle of Copenhagen. A committee
have the management of the room, but its general superintendence
devolves on the secretary. Correct mercantile
information can always be obtained there; and every
stranger is at perfect liberty to collect the news of the day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">-&nbsp;38&nbsp;-</a></span>
although, from the nature of the institution, none but
British subjects can subscribe. To enjoy the privilege of
reading in the rooms, the parties must be regularly introduced
by a subscriber.<a id="FN9"></a><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> All British residents of respectability
are expected to subscribe.</p>

<p>The members dine together once in every quarter, at
Faunch&rsquo;s hotel, and discuss the affairs of the society.</p>

<p>The British Commercial Room is held in the house of
Mrs. Clark,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Dona Clara; and what person has visited
Buenos Ayres without hearing of this lady&mdash;the &ldquo;Lady
Bountiful&rdquo; of the place?</p>

<p>There is a library of English books attached to the
room, consisting of 600 volumes, and which is every day
increasing. It is a distinct affair; and natives of all countries
can subscribe to it. Several Creole gentlemen, who
speak English, North Americans, &amp;c. belong to it. The
secretary to the Commercial Room acts as librarian.</p>

<p>Some individuals have attributed illiberality to the Commercial
Room, in not permitting those of other nations to
become members; but, waiving the right which the British
have for an establishment of their own, if they like to support
it, Great Britain might be involved in war, and it could
not then be pleasant to come in daily contact with natives
of hostile countries.</p>

<p>Letters arriving by British vessels were, until October,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">-&nbsp;39&nbsp;-</a></span>
1821, forwarded to the Commercial Room, which collected
and paid the government the postage; but this arrangement
always caused great jealousy to foreigners, and they
are now sent to the Post Office, where every facility is afforded.
Many English letters, however, to persons up the
country, never reach their destination, from the practice
of allowing any one to take letters from the office who will
pay for them: mean curiosity has caused the loss of many
letters by this mode.</p>

<p>The recent establishment of packets to Buenos Ayres
(<!--added-->the first of which, the Countess of Chichester, arrived on
the 16th April, 1824) is an event of some consequence.
They bring the correspondence for Chili and Peru, opening
a direct and speedy communication with regions, which
Spanish jealousy, not many years ago, had shut out from
the rest of the world. The captains of these packets must
not, for the present, expect to find their employments to
Buenos Ayres very lucrative: but little specie goes home,
and there are few passengers that can afford to pay the
packet price, which really is not exorbitant, considering
the excellent accommodations and fare provided; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i> For
the cabin, &pound;80 sterling; steerage, &pound;40. Their arrival is
looked forward to with great anxiety by all classes. At
first, they made long passages; latterly, they have improved
in this respect: the <i>Lord Hobart</i> packet came out
in forty-seven days; the <i>Eclipse</i> brought thirteen passengers,
chiefly gentlemen connected with mining affairs.
They will soon prove a profitable employment to their
commanders; and, certainly, the system altogether reflects
the highest credit upon the British government, the only
nation which has such an establishment.</p>

<p>The inclination which Englishmen, engaged in business,
have, when at home, to live away from the scene of their
pursuits, at a short distance from town, is shewn here; and
we have the Stockwells, the Kenningtons, the Newingtons,
the Camberwells, &amp;c. of Buenos Ayres, with the attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">-&nbsp;40&nbsp;-</a></span>
farm-yards, orchards, and gardens, similar to those in the
vicinity of London, wanting only the stages, and the eighteen-penny
ride from the Bank and Gracechurch Street.
Their houses may be easily recognized, from the degree
of neatness and comfort attached. The house of Mr. Fair,
situated upon an eminence near the water-side, southward
of the Fort, is a good land-mark. Mr. F. has lately built it
at a considerable expence. Mr. Cope&rsquo;s house, near the
Retiro, I think the most pleasantly situated of all.</p>

<p>The British have been engaged in numerous disputes
with this government. The last that occurred was in April,
1821, upon the decree ordering all foreigners to take up
arms; which the British very properly refused to do, for
it could not be expected they would submit to be made
parties in their quarrels. Captain O&rsquo;Brien, of H.M.S.
<i>Slaney</i>, then at anchor in the outer roads,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> was appointed
British agent, and a long correspondence took place. The
affair was, however, settled by the merchants, and Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">-&nbsp;41&nbsp;-</a></span>
O&rsquo;Brien felt displeased, conceiving that, having been thrust
forward officially, every arrangement ought to have come
through him. This quarrel caused some stir in Buenos
Ayres. One or two members of the Junta threatened us
lustily; but those Tybalts were silenced by the moderate
party. Since then, Mr. Rivadavia&rsquo;s administration has
made every thing go on amicably and smoothly.</p>

<p>The dispute between Captain Willes, of H.M.S. <i>Brazen</i>,
and the government of Buenos Ayres, caused a considerable
bustle. Captain W. was ordered, by his instructions,
to board all vessels of his nation upon their arrival; in the
execution of which, his boat was fired upon by the gun-brig
stationed outside. Other disagreements took place;
and Captain W. was ordered to quit the shore in two
hours. He did so. When on board, fruitless efforts took
place to accommodate matters. The boats of H.M. ship
took possession of their brig, and sent her to the inner
roads. The public mind was inflamed by a string of falsehoods
and misrepresentations published in the <cite>Centinella</cite>
newspaper; the doors of one or two English houses had
threatening placards stuck upon them; and a list was
handed about for signatures, to avenge the insult offered
to their flag. I am not aware, if they meant to attack the
<i>Brazen</i>; volunteers for such an expedition, I should think,
would have been scarce. The British addressed a note to
Captain W. soliciting, that, if consistent with his duty, he
would leave Buenos Ayres, as the present irritation might
lead to extremes. The <i>Brazen</i> sailed for Colonia; her
captain stating, that nothing but consideration for his
countrymen on shore should have tempted him so to do:
and thus the affair ended.</p>

<p>The government had promised protection to British persons
and property, the quarrel being a private one; but
retaliation would, no doubt, have taken place, had Captain
Willes remained, and seized any of their vessels. The
Buenos Ayres government were somewhat precipitate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">-&nbsp;42&nbsp;-</a></span>
in their proceedings, and wanting in their respect to
the officer of a nation, which, if not in alliance, was on
terms of strictest friendship with them. It was regretted
by many, that Captain Willes refused to come on shore,
when solicited by Mr. Rivadavia. Our captain was sadly
hampered by what he conceived to be his duty, and the
alarm on shore. Those gentlemen who had been long
settled in the country, with their wives and families, wished,
I have no doubt, that the Brazen had been a thousand
miles off, particularly the female branches; though none, I
trust, possessed spirits so mean, as to brook insult for the
enjoyment of present comfort.</p>

<p>The outer roads had long been an object of dispute. I
regret that, in this instance, it should have deprived us of
the society of an officer, whose amiable manners and disposition
delight all who have the happiness of knowing him.
At Monte Video, Captain Willes was literally adored. I
do not think the British would have been seriously molested,
for they had numerous friends in the town, and Captain
Willes was not without his advocates. A pamphlet, shortly
after, appeared, said to be written by an Englishman, exposing
the malevolence of the <cite>Centinella</cite>.</p>

<p>The appointment of consuls will prevent these disputes
in future. Our naval officers are not the best diplomatists;
they would, as a member in the House of Commons observed,
&ldquo;much rather fight than write.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some Germans, in Buenos Ayres, were in a terrible
fright, lest they should be taken for Englishmen, when the
supposed work of retaliation should begin. In complexion
and appearance, they much resemble us, and they nearly
all speak English. Germans and Americans are all denominated
Englishmen by the natives; they cannot find
out the distinction. A Creole boy once told me, that he
supposed every body to be my countryman, that could say,
<i>How do you do?</i> in English.</p>

<p>In the little disagreements that take place on the beach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">-&nbsp;43&nbsp;-</a></span>
between the sailors and the natives, the term <i>English
brute</i> is always applied to the former. These disputes
are rare, for our sailors do not mix much amongst them.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodbine Parish, the British consul-general for
Buenos Ayres, seems well adapted for the station he fills:
his manners are mild and gentlemanly. The two vice-consuls,
Messrs. Griffiths and Pousset, share in the same
praise; the latter, in countenance and figure, much resembles
the royal family; if he were a trifle more portly,
one might fancy him the Duke of York.</p>

<p>The different states of this part of South America, such
as Entre Rios, Cordova, Santa Fe, Mendoza, &amp;c. sent
Members, to attend the congress in Buenos Ayres, empowering
the government to act for them in the treaty with
England; which, after considerable discussion, has been
signed and ratified. Mr. Parish, attended by the vice-consuls
and other gentlemen, went in state to pay his respects
to the governor upon the occasion. The reception
of the consul was, of course, flattering: the flag was hoisted
at the fort, and a gun fired. The clause which caused
most debate in the congress, was that of religious toleration.
Some of the members seemed alarmed. It was,
however, allowed, with free liberty for Protestants to build
their own places of public worship. This is something
gained from ancient prejudices. I have not, however, a high
opinion of English devoutness in Buenos Ayres. We have
now a sort of prayer, or methodist meeting, held in a private
house. A captain of a Liverpool brig brought out some
religious tracts, which he circulated, and hoisted the Bethel
flag in his vessel: I fear he found Buenos Ayres an uncongenial
spot for those subjects.</p>

<p>Another article in this treaty which has given general
satisfaction, is, that no British subject shall be compelled
to military service. In any disputes upon this topic, the
British have been the only foreigners who have stood
forward to resist it; the others have remained passive
spectators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">-&nbsp;44&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>On Sundays and holidays, the British and American
consuls hoist the flags of their respective nations from the
tops of their houses. The Buenos Ayres flag floats by the
side of the American: Colonel Forbes, like a skilful
manager, studies the taste of the town.</p>

<p>I have noticed, that many of my countrymen, in their
desire to visit their native land, still talk of returning to
Buenos Ayres. They certainly must feel some attachment
to a country in which they have lived happily for a series
of years. Eight or ten years of absence from home makes
a great alteration amongst our dearest friends; some are
dead, and others are absent, or indifferent. In England,
too, every one must be content to mix with the crowd.</p>

<p>A great many of the English are perfect masters of the
Spanish language, having obtained their knowledge of it
by a long residence in the country, and by coming to it at a
very early age. I have been surprised at the quickness
with which English children learn it: in a few months they
are able to carry on a conversation, whilst those of riper
age take years to attain it. When a man gets near thirty
years of age, he feels little inclination to study languages.</p>

<p>In mentioning any thing of the English females in
Buenos Ayres, I feel a delicacy bordering on timidity,
and ought to recollect the homely proverb, &ldquo;The least
said is the soonest mended.&rdquo; Certain, however, it is, that,
with some exceptions, they are not a fair specimen of our
country. Those placed in the higher circles are few in number,
and appear to be amiable women, as are many whom I
will take the liberty of calling the second class; but with
respect to the lower orders, I can only say, that I have been
more than once reminded of the neighbourhood of St. Giles&rsquo;s.
In reply to some remarks of a Spanish lady, I mustered
courage to tell her, that, in spite of all the charming women
of Buenos Ayres, we had those at home who equalled, if
not far surpassed them; of which I would speedily convince
her, could I, with Harlequin&rsquo;s wand, waft her to my country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">-&nbsp;45&nbsp;-</a></span>
where they may be seen in all their charms of beauty and
splendour; and that the few who traversed the ocean,
formed no criterion, a voyage to South America being
rather a serious undertaking for a lady.</p>

<p>In commenting upon the dowdy appearance which some
of the British females make in this country, I am not singular;&mdash;all
my countrymen converse upon it, and join me
in my opinion.</p>

<p>Families should never think of bringing pretty unmarried
servant girls with them from Europe; they are almost sure
of losing them. Be the girls ever so determined, they
will find a difficulty in resisting the offers of marriage
from the numerous English bachelor mechanics, who are
at a sad loss for wives:&mdash;a Spanish wife is not to their
taste. Therefore, those who wish to keep their servants,
must choose the ugliest they can procure&mdash;something that
may be an antidote to the warm passions of our English
Damons. An importation of British females with tolerable
personal charms would answer here, as well as in many
other places abroad. I wish some adventurer would
beat up for recruits amongst the nursery maids at the
west end of the town in London; it would be an excellent
speculation, and serve the poor girls into the bargain.</p>

<p>Several Englishmen have married Buenos Ayrean ladies;
and, from all accounts, they do not repent having done so.
The worst of it is, in marrying into Spanish families, one
may be said to marry all the family, for they expect to
reside under the same roof. The English resist this,
and with success: the good sense of their wives will make
them conform to our ideas; yet the parting of a beloved
daughter from the paternal roof must be a painful task
for parents, whose only consolation is in yielding her to
the arms of the man she loves.</p>

<p>Englishmen married to Spanish females have been, in
a degree, obliged to conform to the Catholic ceremonies
of marriage. The over-scrupulous will start at this; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">-&nbsp;46&nbsp;-</a></span>
if they have ever been in love, they will readily conceive
that these oaths of form may be swallowed with as much
ease as many of the absurd ones of our Custom-House.
The difference of religion, in liberal minds, cannot in
any way disturb domestic harmony: we differ only in
forms.</p>

<p>So great were religious prejudices not many years ago,
that a lady would have hesitated, and her family interfered
to prevent a marriage with one of &ldquo;heretic creed.&rdquo; The
alteration is a credit to their understandings; it evinces
that they are neither bigots nor fanatics. A generation of
children are now springing up, half English, half Creolian,
speaking both languages; their fathers teaching them
English, their mothers Spanish. Could we look a few years
forward, and see these youngsters grown to maturity, loving
the land of their birth, and having a yearning towards
that of their fathers, what important consequences may
not result, in cementing friendships between nations that
once regarded each other with a rooted dislike.</p>

<p>Englishmen who have married in this country, I should
presume, intend making it their adopted land. It is an
alternative that would cause me to pause: I could not
consent to lose the hope of again seeing my paternal home.
Now, if I could fancy such an event, as taking my Buenos
Ayrean wife with me to London, lodging her in some
fashionable mansion near Grosvenor Square, or in the
Square itself&mdash;visiting the Opera and all the Theatres&mdash;pointing
out to her Rossini, Catalani, our Braham,
Stephens, Kean, and Macready, and explaining their
different talents, poor Rosquellas, and the Se&ntilde;oras Tani,
would be quite forgotten; and, instead of a ride on the
Barracca Road, or to San Jos&eacute; de Flores, San Isidro, &amp;c.
conducting her along the Queen&rsquo;s Road to Putney, Richmond,
or Windsor&mdash;taking a stroll with her in Kensington
Gardens&mdash;Heavens! whither will my imagination lead me?
and why cannot I persuade some kind-hearted Creolian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">-&nbsp;47&nbsp;-</a></span>
to give me his daughter, and two hundred thousand dollars,
in return for the fond love I should lavish on her?</p>

<p>The marriages of English people have been performed
by captains of vessels of war, or in the presence of two
or three merchants, whose signatures are said to be sufficient
acts of parliament. The residence of a consul will
obviate some of these difficulties.</p>

<p>The British community, in Buenos Ayres, lost one of its
chief ornaments, by a melancholy suicide, which took place
in December, 1824&mdash;that of Mr. Dallas, who cut his throat
with a razor: disappointment in business is stated to be
the cause. He has not left his equal in Buenos Ayres; his
character fully warranted that expressive term in the
English language&mdash;a perfect gentleman.</p>

<p>The death of Mr. Rowcroft, in Peru, caused infinite regret
amongst the British in Buenos Ayres, by whom he
was much respected. He was, probably, the first alderman
of the city of London that ever crossed the Andes. It
was hard to meet his death by the bullets of foreign soldiery.
It is some consolation, that accident alone caused the fatal
affair. It is said, that he was taken for a Spanish officer,
Mr. R. being clothed in his uniform as Colonel of the City
Light Horse, a dress he appeared particularly proud of.</p>

<p>A son of Sir Robert Wilson arrived here, and went to
Peru; but he soon returned, and went to the Brazils, in
order to join his father&rsquo;s friend, Lord Cochrane.</p>

<p>Amongst my countrymen in this city, may be found some
very eccentric characters, who would be accounted originals
even at home.</p>

<p>Who has visited Buenos Ayres without having heard of
the noisy drunken Englishman, Jack Hall, the Caleb
Quotem of the town, and who, in appearance and dress,
looked as if he had just escaped from Newgate. Poor
Jack died in July, 1824, and was carried to the grave in
his own cart, which had, for a series of years, borne so
many of his countrymen to their last abode, and on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">-&nbsp;48&nbsp;-</a></span>
account was called &ldquo;the English hearse.&rdquo; Hall was a
Jack of all trades, painter, glazier, whitewasher, &amp;c. &amp;c.
The Spaniards, when he first arrived amongst them, viewed
him as a prodigy.</p>

<p>Irishmen naturalized into American citizens, or what are
called &ldquo;Irish Yankies,&rdquo; from time to time pass through
Buenos Ayres, on their route to different parts: I have
known several. It is heart-rending to think, that political
events should thus have estranged men from their native
country, and made them its bitterest enemies. It is true,
they &ldquo;rail against a rock they cannot pull down.&rdquo; If an
excuse can be found for them, it is that the hopes of their
youth have been <a id="blighted">blighted</a>, and that oppression has made
them aliens to their native land. North Americans remark,
that those who abuse Great Britain most in the United
States are our own countrymen. I believe it; and in the
falsification of their long-told predictions of England&rsquo;s
downfall, there is a wider field opened for their hate, and
to brood upon what is to happen to ill-fated England.</p>

<p>As regards some Irishmen whom I have known (or, if it
must be so, &ldquo;Irish Yankies&rdquo;), I sincerely regret that I cannot
embrace them, take them by the hand, and call them
countrymen. I have noticed them to be men of warm
imaginations; and when listening to any detail of Irish
intrepidity in the French war&mdash;and where is it that Irish
blood has not flowed in torrents for the cause of Great
Britain?&mdash;their hearts appeared elated, and they knew
every Irish officer who had distinguished himself; they
spoke of his deeds with rapture, and, for the moment,
assumed their natural character of British subjects;&mdash;for,
say what they will, a man feels little enthusiasm in the
glories of any nation but his own. I congratulated one
upon the change in his ideas:&mdash;he started; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I regret not the past; I am, and ever will remain, an
American citizen.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">-&nbsp;49&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>There are three <span class="smcap">North-American</span> mercantile houses&mdash;Mr.
Ford; Zimmerman and Co.; and Stewart and M&rsquo;Call.
The residents are few, excepting the casual visitors. I
find a difficulty in distinguishing them from Englishmen,
though a Creole friend of mine pretended to do it, describing
the Americans as generally wearing white hats, spectacles,
and carrying a stick. This observation I afterwards found
tolerably correct. We laugh at their phrases&mdash;&ldquo;I
guess,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I calculate,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I expect,&rdquo; &amp;c.; and they retort
upon our continual use of &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; in conversation.
It will be well for the two nations, if their future differences
consist only in laughing at each other&rsquo;s peculiarities of
speech.</p>

<p>The North Americans carry on a considerable trade in
this river, and have brought some valuable cargoes from
China and India. Flour, lumber, a few dry goods, soap,
&amp;c. are their general import; salt vessels also arrive from
the Cape de Verd, which article is at times very profitable.
Now and then the domestic manufactures of North America
are brought to this market; but the profit of them, if
any, must be very small. The immense capital, machinery,
and talent of England, must for a long time give her the advantage
over every other nation; and as regards North America,
I should not suppose it would answer her purpose to
divert her population from the health-inspiring pursuits of
agriculture to a pernicious manufacture. Their chief commerce
is in flour; and owing to one or two bad harvests in
this province, the advantages have been great. It has been
sold at thirty dollars per barrel; the cost in North America
being only seven or eight. During the year 1823, upwards of
70,000 barrels of flour was thus imported into Buenos Ayres.
For a country so luxuriant in soil to be dependent upon
foreigners for bread, appears strange; but agriculture is
yet young in South America.</p>

<p>The North-American trade is mostly carried on in ships
with supercargoes: the captains are a superior set of men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">-&nbsp;50&nbsp;-</a></span>
But few English ships arrive; they are nearly all brigs,
commanded by our roughest seamen: but these brigs
often contain valuable cargoes. The Americans manage to
run about the world with small cargoes. A number of
their vessels come here for the purpose of being sold and
broken up; which seems to be a good speculation, if we
may judge from the number hauled upon the beach for that
purpose: those ships that cut such a dashing figure at first
sight, have only &ldquo;a goodly outside, but are rotten within.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The circumstance of North America having been the
first to acknowledge the independence of this province has
not insured to her any particular commercial privileges.
In a coffee-house, one evening, I witnessed a serious debate
amongst some Creolians; one of them, in the heat of argument,
asserted that the acknowledgment by North America
was of no more consequence to the state, than if the province
of Santa F&eacute; had done so. The acknowledgment by
Spain and England is what materially interests them:
North America, however, has decidedly paved the way for
this.</p>

<p>Although there are a great many North-American mechanics,
yet we find very few of them have shops of their
own in Buenos Ayres. In the manufacture of boots, shoes,
hats, &amp;c. as well as dry goods, they must yield the palm to
us. In the stores, a preference is given to English hams,
cheeses, &amp;c.; but I have tasted American articles of this
description, of good quality. The Americans, aware of the
partiality, pass off many of their goods as English; and I
have purchased American soap with the British crown
impressed upon it.</p>

<p>Perhaps in no part of the world has such a marked
distance been kept between Americans and Englishmen
as in Buenos Ayres; but this, I rejoice to observe, is
subsiding. Both parties are to blame. The English are
said to be the most conceited nation on earth; it may be
true, but our North-American friends have a touch of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">-&nbsp;51&nbsp;-</a></span>
quality likewise. When told of this; their reply, that &ldquo;their
vices they inherit from us; their virtues are peculiarly their
own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr.<!--added .--> Rodney, the minister from North America, departed
this life on the 10th of June, 1824. His death was sudden,
from an attack of apoplexy. The evening previous to his
decease, he had a large assemblage of visitors at his house.
He was a plain republican of the old school, and much
esteemed by all parties: he has left a large family. The
government of Buenos Ayres evinced the most marked
respect to his memory.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Colonel Forbes is the Secretary of
Legation: he has been in Buenos Ayres since October,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">-&nbsp;52&nbsp;-</a></span>
1820, and acted as agent to the United States till the arrival
of Mr. Rodney.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <span class="smcap">French</span> are numerous in Buenos Ayres; report says,
they are equal in number to the British, but I do not believe
it. Their trade here, what there is of it, must be advantageous:
they bring every requisite for the ladies&rsquo; toilet;
fans, silk stockings, perfumery, scented waters, gloves,
jewellery, and those nic-nacs in which the French so
much excel. Some shops make a great figure in French
goods, as silks, shawls, and every essential to gratify female
taste. Roquin, Meyer, &amp; Co. is the chief mercantile French
house; but there are numbers of Buenos Ayrean and other
firms, that import largely from France, as do also some
English houses.</p>

<p>There are many gentlemanly and intelligent men amongst
the French settled in Buenos Ayres; but the mass will not
bear a comparison with the British in point of respectability.
Frenchmen themselves allow this, and laugh at the billiard-markers
and waiters of Parisian growth. The superior
class are to be found in the best societies of the city. Their
lively manners and conversation have ever been a contrast
to the reserve of the English; and, as companions, they
may be more sought after than my modest countrymen:
a Frenchman is at home in all countries.</p>

<p>The English likewise visit the first families, and give at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">-&nbsp;53&nbsp;-</a></span>
times splendid entertainments, or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tertulias</i>; yet, I have
fancied, they appear more happy when amongst themselves.
Their behaviour has been attributed to pride and many other
causes: the French term &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mauvaise honte</i>,&rdquo; affords a better
solution. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, I am convinced,
the British character is esteemed; and, however the
French may beat us in companionship, they cannot deprive
us of that esteem.</p>

<p>The news of Napoleon&rsquo;s death caused great tribulation
in French society at Buenos Ayres. It was some time ere
they would believe it; it must be a trick, they said, of the
English; and until the causes of his death became so well
authenticated, expressions of foul play were more than
whispered. Their love for this &ldquo;man of blood&rdquo; has ceased
to astonish me: were I a Frenchman, it is probable I should
love him too.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> On Bonaparte&rsquo;s birth-day, in 1821, I observed
the tri-coloured flag, waving from a French <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pulperia</i>
near the beach. This flag, once so formidable, and which
made every Briton prepare for &ldquo;bloody fight,&rdquo; now floats
harmlessly in Buenos Ayres, being used as a signal for
merchant vessels.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A great many <span class="smcap">Portuguese</span> are residents of Buenos
Ayres, as merchants, shopkeepers, &amp;c.; they carry on a
constant commerce with the Brazils.</p>

<p>The jealousy, bordering upon contempt, in which the
Spaniards affect to hold the Portuguese, is very conspicuous
here. At the theatre, when a Portuguese character is
represented, the performer is arrayed fantastically, strutting
about the stage with self-assumed importance, amidst vehement
laughter and applause, as fervent and more boisterous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">-&nbsp;54&nbsp;-</a></span>
than that bestowed upon Sheridan&rsquo;s &ldquo;little cunning Portuguese,&rdquo;
Isaac Mendoza.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Germans, Italians</span>, and, indeed, the natives of all
countries, are to be met with in Buenos Ayres, as merchants,
store and shopkeepers, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Mr. Schmaling, agent to the <span class="smcap">Prussian</span> <i>Linen Company</i>,
has lately established an extensive mercantile house in
Buenos Ayres. The Prussian cloths and flannels have
been bought with much avidity, a preference being given to
them from their being cheaper, and some say better than
our&rsquo;s. Mr. S. sold his cloths 20 per cent. cheaper than
the English could afford to sell. It is hard to be undersold
in a foreign market, in what was once considered our staple
commodity. British skill, however, I have no doubt, will
surmount this temporary advantage: the repeal of the wool
tax may be one step towards it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Persons, Dispositions, and Manners of the Native
or Spanish Inhabitants</span>.&mdash;It might be supposed, from the
latitude in which Buenos Ayres is situated, that the faces and
general appearance of the natives would partake of a dusky
hue: as regards the male sex, this is certainly the case, though
here and there the reverse is seen. Of the females, however,
many can boast a countenance of roses and lilies, equal to
those of a colder climate. Amongst the mulatto cast, there
are some pretty girls. I have noticed that some distinctions
are kept up, the word <em>mulatto</em> being often used as a
term of reproach: this is illiberal. One or two families
of red-haired children are rather remarkable in a country
where the darker hue predominates. I really thought they
were of Scotch extraction, till I was informed to the contrary.
Some scandalous wits have dared to be jocular on
the occasion, asserting that they must be the offspring of
Beresford&rsquo;s Scotch regiment, the 71st, who were here in
1806.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">-&nbsp;55&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>It is rarely we see, in Buenos Ayres, a person marked
with the small pox, vaccination being generally practised;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
and very few deformed people. Indeed, the generality of
them may be called handsome. The young men are well
grown, possess good figures, and their manners render them
truly agreeable.</p>

<p>Faces may be seen here, of female beauty, worthy a
painter&rsquo;s study;&mdash;the intelligent dark eye, polished forehead,
and persons moulded by grace itself. England is
called the land of beauty, and it deserves its name; but
beauty is not peculiar to England alone. Buenos Ayres
contains within its walls as much loveliness as imagination
can dream of.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The stately elegance of walk, for which the Spanish
ladies are so remarkable, is in no place more conspicuous
than in Buenos Ayres; and it is not confined to the upper
class&mdash;females of all descriptions possess it; one must therefore
conclude it to be an acquired accomplishment. If my
fair countrywomen would deign to imitate them in this
respect, and get rid of that ungraceful postman-like pace
they now have, I should love them all the better.</p>

<p>The inhabitants possess a happy medium between French
vivacity and English reserve. An Englishman feels at
home with them; for should he be deficient in the language,
he need not fear that his blunders will be laughed at. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">-&nbsp;56&nbsp;-</a></span>
sickness, they are proverbial for their kind attention, as
many of my countrymen have experienced, preparing every
little delicacy they think will please. It is only to know
these people, to esteem them.</p>

<p>Their happy disposition, and having so few real cares, protect
them from suicide, that calamity which afflicts populous
Europe. The future provision for a family, indeed,
scarcely enters their thoughts, in a country where &ldquo;a fathom
of beef can be purchased for sixpence.&rdquo; This expression
was used by an English &ldquo;beach-ranger,&rdquo; when trying to
prevail upon some of a Falmouth packet&rsquo;s crew to desert.</p>

<p>Although there may be families who, in the common
acceptation of the term, are well off, yet I do not think
there are many who are extraordinarily rich, that is to say,
worth from 30 to &pound;50,000 sterling. Houses, cattle, and
land constitute the best property.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm with which the Spaniards regard the
female sex, like most other things, has, doubtless, been
exaggerated. In Buenos Ayres, if they have not exactly
caught this enthusiasm, they have done better: their attentions
are founded on real respect to the virtues of the sex,
and are therefore more likely to last.</p>

<p>The character given to Spaniards of all descriptions for
jealousy of their females, must have been either fabulous,
or a great change has taken place; for nothing approaching
to it can be observed in their descendants here. The gentlemen
conduct themselves with the most marked politeness
towards the females, paying them the greatest attention
and respect. I have heard it asserted, that they make negligent
husbands. In every populous city, no doubt, many
of this class are to be found; but those Buenos Ayrean
husbands, whom I have the pleasure of knowing, seem
devotedly attached to their wives, behaving with a tenderness
not every day found even in England, that land of
domestic felicity.</p>

<p>The ladies appear equal in affection; and are kind and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">-&nbsp;57&nbsp;-</a></span>
tender mothers. It is pleasing to see the care and fondness
they bestow on their children. A stranger need not be a
day in Buenos Ayres without discovering this; and such
traits speak volumes. They do not follow the unmotherly
practice of putting their infants out to nurse, thinking it no
disgrace to suckle their own offspring. In my opinion,
there is as fair a proportion of married happiness in this
city, as can be found in those that bear a name of being
more domesticated.</p>

<p>The compliments of salutation are much the name as in
England with the gentlemen, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i> the good old hearty
shake of the hand. The French embrace of the males,
kissing each other, is not followed; for which I am better
pleased. Much as I esteem my friends of Buenos Ayres,
I wish no other than female lips to touch my cheek. The
salutation of the females, on bidding adieu for long journeys,
or on returning from one, is kissing and embracing each
other: in this respect they differ but little from British
females&mdash;perhaps a little more fervent. I have seen ladies,
when returned from a voyage to Monte Video, hug their
old black servant, who has come to meet them on the beach,
with all the ardour of affection, so different from our notions
of propriety.</p>

<p>Should a lady be seized with a fit of yawning, she crosses
herself with the most burlesque sanctity. The style in which
they cross themselves, requires a rehearsal to understand it:
they touch the cheeks, chin, and bosom, quick, with the
thumb, or, as a military man would denominate it, &ldquo;in
double quick time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A very pleasing practice exists, of giving flowers to
visitors, as a mark of respect: some fair lady hands a rose
or tulip. I recollect, a charming girl gave me a rose, a few
days after my arrival, and my vanity was not a little gratified
by it; and I felt some mortification in finding it was only
the common civility of the place.</p>

<p>Smoking segars is a general practice&mdash;I might almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">-&nbsp;58&nbsp;-</a></span>
add, with men, women, and children; the ladies of the
better class always excepted, though report says, they will,
in secret, take the luxury of a segar. I hope report has
erred in this respect&mdash;indeed, I think it has; for such an
outrage against my English feelings, as a Buenos Ayrean
lady smoking, would abate much of the enthusiasm I feel
for them. In the male sex I like to see it; and the pleasure
it seems to afford, has repeatedly made me regret that I am
no smoker. Here boys of eight, nine, and ten years of age,
may be seen smoking.</p>

<p>The English soon get into the fashion; and most of
them are as fond of the segar as the natives, who are
smoking from the time they get up, until they go to bed.
If they ride on horseback, a segar is in their mouths.
Should they want a light in the streets, it is only to stop
the first person they meet smoking, to obtain one. I have
often smiled to see a first-rate Creolian dandy lighting his
segar from that of some dirty black fellow.</p>

<p>Havannah segars are the favourites; but they are dear,
and not at all times to be had in perfection. The paper
ones, or segars de Hoja, made from the tobacco-leaf, are
mostly used, and by many preferred. The manufacture of
them affords employment to a great many people, including
females.</p>

<p>So refined are their ideas of politeness, that a person
smoking invariably takes the segar from his mouth, when
passing another in the street.</p>

<p>In another branch of politeness, Buenos Ayres is not
outdone, even by Paris itself; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i> the constant custom of
taking off the hat, when meeting each other in the street.
The English mode of touching the hat is too groom and
footman-like, to be followed here: their&rsquo;s is taken entirely
from the head; and, when in compliment to ladies, they remain
uncovered until the objects of their politeness have
passed. It is managed gracefully&mdash;removing the hat from
behind, similar to those who are accustomed to wear wigs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">-&nbsp;59&nbsp;-</a></span>
it may be, to save the fronts from dilapidation, which such
continual calls on them would occasion.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The plant called <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">yerba</i>, the growth of Paraguay and the
Brazils, is the tea of Buenos Ayres. They drink it out of
a small globe, to which a tube is fixed, nearly as long as our
tobacco-pipe; it is called the matt&eacute;-pot, and the beverage
drawn from the yerba, is the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">matt&eacute;</i>. These pots are generally
of silver; and they hand them from one to the other,
in drinking&mdash;a practice not the most cleanly. When I first
saw the tubes in the ladies&rsquo; mouths, I conceived they were
smoking. Matt&eacute; has not a bad flavour, but nothing equal
to tea. It is reported by some to be pernicious to the
teeth. In visiting parties it is always handed round. It
carries such an idea of the tobacco-pipe, that I do not much
admire seeing these matt&eacute;-pots in the hands of ladies.</p>

<p>The general time of meals in Buenos Ayrean families
is pretty nearly as follows:&mdash;They have <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">matt&eacute;</i> the first
thing, which they often take in bed; at eight or nine,
they have what we should call breakfast, beef-steaks, &amp;c.;
dinner at two and three; <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">matt&eacute;</i> at six and seven, followed
often by a supper. The fashionable London hours of
breakfasting at one and two in the afternoon, and dining
at eight and nine in the evening, have not travelled to
this quarter of the globe yet. They drink wine out of
tumbler glasses.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">siesta</i>, or afternoon nap, is not so regularly taken
as formerly: they have got more into the habits of business,
and cannot afford time for sleeping in the day; and it does
away with the remark, that, during <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">siesta</i> time, nobody is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">-&nbsp;60&nbsp;-</a></span>
to be seen in the streets, but Englishmen and dogs. The
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">siesta</i> has its regular season; it is supposed to begin with
the summer season, in October, and end at the close of the
summer, or passion week. The plodding and industrious
world cry out against this practice, as encouraging sloth;
but I think a nap after dinner, in warm latitudes, both refreshing
and conducive to health.</p>

<p>Houses are not provided with the convenience of bells:
their servants are summoned either by calling, or making
a noise upon the tables. At meals, the servants and slaves
are in attendance at the table.</p>

<p>They retire to rest, in winter, at ten or eleven; in summer,
later, as at this season they enjoy the cool of the evening
from the azoteas, or from seats near the windows.</p>

<p>A walk in the streets on a fine summer&rsquo;s night is not uninteresting,
from the number of ladies walking and at the windows.
Evening is the time devoted by ladies to shopping.
A night previous to a holiday or Sunday, the shops are
crowded.</p>

<p>In families of respectability, which have unmarried daughters,
weekly <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tertulias</i>, or public dances, are often held
during the winter, which, they say, are for the purpose
of shewing the young ladies off, and getting them husbands:
as I am not in the secret, I only give it as I hear it.</p>

<p>These dances are got up at very little expence or preparation.
One of the ladies presides at the piano; the
refreshments are cakes, sweetmeats, and liqueurs: a few
dollars provides for all; and I like their plan&mdash;it looks
more like a friendly entertainment. The sumptuous repasts
provided on such occasions in England, bespeak
so much of ceremony as considerably to mar the pleasure.</p>

<p>On birth-days, compliments are sent and received, with
presents of sweetmeats, &amp;c. and dinners and tertulias are
given. Those days are more kept up than with us; but
the itinerant musicians, about the doors, has a little fallen
off lately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">-&nbsp;61&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Sweetmeats are much eaten, and by the children in large
quantities. In coffee-houses they sprinkle the toast with
sugar: an English child would call them &ldquo;sugar-babies.&rdquo; I
am not dentist enough to decide whether this is one of the
causes of decayed teeth, so often observed in young people,
and the prevailing malady of the tooth-ache; but persons
are continually seen with their faces tied up for this complaint:
it is, indeed, a disease of the country. Bad teeth
is a sad drawback, as they are both &ldquo;useful and ornamental;&rdquo;
and the purchase of new teeth and gums, in
Buenos Ayres, would be rather difficult: besides, all the
world must know about it. In London and Paris, such
things pass as nothing.</p>

<p>When walking in public, the female rarely takes the arm
of a gentleman, except it be night. This seems to us an
unsocial fashion. At dark, however, the restriction ceases,
and ladies will then honour us by accepting our arm: with
married persons this is more common. The Englishman
and his wife, in spite of Spanish modes, are seen trotting
comfortably along the Alameda, on a Sunday, arm-in-arm,
as if at home.</p>

<p>Neither is it the fashion for gentlemen to escort the ladies,
but to the theatre, or public places: their visits and shopping
are in company only with their own sex. If a fair lady
should wave this rule, and allow us to proceed by their side
for a few streets, it would be the height of vulgarity to offer
the arm. In England we have other notions of gentility.</p>

<p>At the ball room, the females sit together, when not
engaged in dancing. During this pause, some gentleman
will, with hesitating steps, approach them, and solicit a lady
to waltz, or dance a minuet with him.</p>

<p>The Spaniards pride themselves upon the delicacy and
respect with which they treat the females; and though
there are many Spanish customs which I think &ldquo;more
honoured in the breach than the observance,&rdquo; this is one, I
trust, will last for ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">-&nbsp;62&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The Buenos Ayreans are passionately fond of dancing.
Their evening hours are given to this pastime: in their
houses, daughters, mothers, nay, grandmothers, will enjoy
it with all the spirit of youth. To me it is the most
gratifying sight&mdash;a proof that age is not always accompanied
by moroseness. I have been delighted to see
father, mother, daughters, and sons, dancing with that
apparent happiness, as if life had no other object but
enjoyment.</p>

<p>Walking in the environs of the town, one evening, a
family dance attracted my attention; and I looked through
the windows. The ladies saw me, and the master of the
house came out, entreating me to enter, with the Spanish
compliment, &ldquo;that his house and family were entirely at
my service.&rdquo; He seemed disappointed at my declining the
invitation. These evening family dances are very fascinating.</p>

<p>It is said, a Frenchman, from his gaiety, never gets old;
the observation applies with equal truth to this people.
In our peculiar England, education, climate, and the
state of society, render its inhabitants more thoughtful
and care-worn: we regard as frivolity what other nations
consider the essentials of existence; yet, in general, we
are not the gloomy people foreigners would paint us.
We can love, and hate, too, with all or more of the fervour
ascribed to warmer climes.</p>

<p>Of the dances, some are pretty. The steps of the Spanish
dances have a great sameness. The ladies appear graceful;
but, indeed, when is it they do not?</p>

<p>The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cielito</i>, or little heaven, is opened by the parties
chaunting a part of a song all the time in movement, and
smacking their fingers together; it then proceeds to the
figure.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contre-danse</i> is involved in intricacies and positions
rather difficult to a stranger; twisting the arms, and
running in and out, like the game of Thread-my-needle, or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">-&nbsp;63&nbsp;-</a></span>
excepting the tumbling part, the comic dance in Mother
Goose. The English contre-danse has more life and
variety both in music and figure.</p>

<p>Waltzing is a favourite: they have not read the lectures
of our moralists upon it, but indulge in the mazes of this
luxurious dance.</p>

<p>The minuet dance here is, I think, tame and ungraceful.</p>

<p>The piano forte is the favourite musical instrument; and
every well-educated young lady is supposed to possess
some knowledge of it. I have heard them perform with
great taste and skill. The young and interesting daughter
of Don Cornelius Saavedra, Do&ntilde;a Dominga, I thought,
excelled; and, with instruction, would be a proficient.
This young lady, with a countenance just &ldquo;budding into
beauty,&rdquo; has talents, which, if properly cultivated, will
adorn society. Her father, Don Cornelius, was the first
Director of the Province after the Revolution, and one
of the old and respectable families. His manners are
very pleasing: in person, he much resembles a British
general officer. Like many others, he has forsaken the
sword for the ploughshare, and resides upon his estate,
ninety miles from town, on the banks of the Parana.</p>

<p>A good piano will sell for 1000 dollars: the English,
in this likewise, take the lead, and those of Clementi,
Stodart, &amp;c. are found in many houses; Miss Saavedra
has a fine-toned one of Clementi&rsquo;s. The French and
German pianos do not readily sell.</p>

<p>Male teachers of music (and, on mentioning these, the
remark of Anastasius occurs to me) find good employment
in this city, where all are so musical. An English lady,
Miss Robinson, gives lessons on this heavenly science.</p>

<p>The Consulado musical school-rooms, with the young
ladies warbling there on a morning, repeatedly attract the
attention of the passing pedestrian. At one o&rsquo;clock, attended
by their mammas and slaves, with music-book
under arm, those little syrens trudge home. On one or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">-&nbsp;64&nbsp;-</a></span>
two occasions, there has been a public trial of musical skill,
a sort of show-off before their relations and friends.</p>

<p>A musical subscription society, called The Philharmonics,
has been established, and the most respectable natives and
foreigners are subscribers. The vocal and instrumental
performers from the theatre attend there. It is a superior
affair, and held in a spacious sala of what was formerly a
prison&mdash;the &ldquo;Coona:&rdquo; Orpheus has driven away the
ministers of justice.</p>

<p>Using an English phrase, the mothers of Buenos Ayres
keep &ldquo;a sharp look-out&rdquo; after their daughters, attending
them to public places, and in the streets. Should the
mother, by any chance, be absent, the care is probably delegated
to a slave or servant, who may have their secret orders
whispered to them, as well as other trusty centinels. But
cannot the slave be bribed? If report speaks true, they are
so; and the ardent lover has been ready to embrace the
black messenger that has conveyed to him tidings from a
beloved mistress.</p>

<p>Young ladies before marriage are, by some mothers,
watched with great strictness, not unlike austerity. I fear,
females here, as well as in other countries, have often given
their hands without their hearts. &ldquo;Why did you marry?&rdquo;
said a friend of mine to a lady who seemed unhappy. &ldquo;To
gain my liberty,&rdquo; she eagerly exclaimed, &ldquo;as many others
have done before me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marriage with the Buenos Ayres female takes place at an
early age, frequently at thirteen and fourteen. Certain it is,
they ripen into womanhood much sooner than those of our
clime; and their beauties more quickly fade. An English
female at forty looks as young as a Buenos Ayrean at thirty.
How many charming and attractive women we find in England
at the age of forty; and though I cannot quite agree
with our gracious sovereign in his admiration of &ldquo;fair, fat,
and forty,&rdquo; yet I have known, at home, some ladies at that
age with charms and acquirements sufficient to alarm a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">-&nbsp;65&nbsp;-</a></span>
sensitive heart. In Buenos Ayres I have likewise seen
females whose beauty seems to improve as years advance;
but this is a rare occurrence.</p>

<p>In marriage, the custom of all the family living together
seems strange to English ideas, and we cannot help picturing
petty jealousies and quarrels amongst such a groupe.
Custom, however, and their natural happy temper, free from
the corroding cares of more populous countries, prevent
these. I cannot help admiring their happiness in this
respect, and I trust they may long enjoy it. I know the
misery I should feel, were I a father, to see a beloved child
depart for ever from the parental roof.</p>

<p>Married females still preserve their maiden name, conjoined
with that of their husband&rsquo;s. The children by such
marriage bear the surname of the father. The saint&rsquo;s-day
on which they may be born provides them with a Christian
name; and, as the Romish church has a saint for every
day in the calendar, the difficulties that the Rev. Mr. Shandy
had to encounter are avoided.</p>

<p>In the lottery of names, people of all classes take their
chance. It is rather droll to hear the black girls addressing
each other by the names of Eugenia, Marcela, Florencia,
&amp;c. Some fair ladies bear the pretty romantic
names of Rosaria, Iren&eacute;, Magdalena, Victoria, Martina,
Fortunata, Celestina, Adriana, &amp;c. whilst others, not so
fortunate in their time of coming into the world, are obliged
to be content with the ordinary ones of Juana, Tomasa, &amp;c.
But what is there in a name? a rose would smell as sweet
under any other name.</p>

<p>John is unquestionably the most vulgar of all names; it
is worse than Tom: every body applies it, when unacquainted
with one&rsquo;s real appellation. In Buenos Ayres,
a stranger is addressed as &ldquo;Don Juan.&rdquo; The Toms and
Jacks of the Spanish vocabulary are softened down into
Tomas and Juan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">-&nbsp;66&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The Spanish custom, when speaking or writing to an individual,
of using the Christian name instead of the surname,
is very pleasing; and as I am a great lover of the
romantic, it will necessarily follow, that I am more charmed
with Don Carlos, Don Henrico, Don Guillermo, &amp;c. than
plain Mr. Smith, Mr. Wilkins, and Mr. Tomkins; and
Do&ntilde;a Clara, Do&ntilde;a Dominga, and Do&ntilde;a Saturnina, than
Miss Williams, Miss White, and Miss Brown.</p>

<p>Respectable families think it no disgrace to let lodgings,
take in washing, make and mend clothes and linen: these
occupations are not looked upon as belonging to the inferior
orders, as with us. Their slaves perform the laborious
part.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17" href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> I was not a little surprised, when I first arrived,
to have an application from the wife of an Alcalde to
perform any jobs in needle-work that I might have. I
concluded the lady meant to jest. The wife of an
Alcalde, a sitting magistrate, to take in needle-work!
thought I. What would the Sir Richard Birnies and
the other sages of Bow-street, Marlborough-street, &amp;c.
say to this?</p>

<p>Washing is dear&mdash;four to ten dollars per month, according
to the clothes washed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">-&nbsp;67&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Slavery has been abolished here, since the year 1810:
those born prior to that time, remain slaves.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The humanity
of the Spaniards to their slaves, compared with other
nations, is well known: in Buenos Ayres they are treated
with great kindness. The female slaves are often placed
more on the footing of friends, than either slaves or servants.
They attend their ladies when visiting, seating
themselves on the ground in the room in which their mistress
may be, and witnessing the dances that continually take
place amongst the members of families. These slave girls,
in consequence, become quite knowing and accomplished,
in their way; and, from being so much in the fashionable
world, imitate their superiors. I have observed them dance
the minuet, and Spanish <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contre-danse</i>, with great elegance.
The men slaves, when deserving, are treated with equal
kindness: it does honour to the humane hearts of their
employers; and I almost adore them for it. In other
countries, it has been my lot to see those unfortunate
people treated with barbarity&mdash;even by my own countrymen.
No ill effects in the end can possibly result from
kind behaviour to the slaves: in Buenos Ayres, they appear
affectionate, happy, and grateful. Of course, discontented
spirits are to be found; but I speak in a general
sense. Of an evening (though I believe it is not a constant
rule), I have seen female slaves seated in the same chamber
with their mistress and family, at needle-work.</p>

<p>Slaves can demand their paper, that is, the deed which
binds them, and seek other employers; and, for cruelty,
can allege a complaint with the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">alcalde</i>. For serious misbehaviour,
a proprietor can have them punished by flogging,
&amp;c. There are other chastisements for females.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">-&nbsp;68&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The men slaves are not numerous; a great portion of
them having enlisted as soldiers.</p>

<p>The English prefer having servants, to slaves, in their
houses, and have purchased but few. Those black gentlemen,
in the employ of Englishmen, have picked up a little
of our language, which they are proud of displaying.</p>

<p>A great many North-American black men are about the
town, and on the beach; crowding the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pulperias</i>.</p>

<p>The negroes have great confidence in the effect of
charms for different diseases: they stick a small bean-shell
to the forehead for the headache; another for the tooth-ache,
&amp;c. They wear, likewise, round the neck, a cross,
with a piece of leather in the shape of a small morocco
purse, like those sold in London: this is a religious
badge.</p>

<p>The excellent and orderly conduct observed by the lower
order of people in the streets, compared with other countries,
is very remarkable: no obscene insulting jests meet
the ear; and persons may accompany modest females in the
street, without dread of molestation from the groups of
all descriptions strolling about, who evince towards the
stranger every respect: we cannot but esteem them, for
thus contributing to render a foreigner&rsquo;s abode in this city
so free from apprehension.</p>

<p>The riotous noise of the English lower orders is by some
called one of the evils of liberty, and I could not consent to
curtail that liberty even to purchase civility from them. I
should, however, be glad if they would condescend to copy,
in some degree, Buenos Ayrean manners. I do not wish
them to be servile&mdash;good manners is not servility; but to
moderate that effusion of liberty, descending sometimes to
ferocity.</p>

<p>Drunkenness is not a vice of this country; the rabble of
blacks and porters are at times so. The mechanic employs
his spare hours with the guitar: on a summer&rsquo;s night, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">-&nbsp;69&nbsp;-</a></span>
doors and windows are open, when they are to be seen
singing, and dancing, and smoking the segar. My countrymen
of the same grade, at home, prefer the comforts of
society in a public house, where they can, over their grog
and song, damn the ministers and taxes, swearing that they
are true-born Britons, back and bone.</p>

<p>From the orderly conduct observed in the streets of
Buenos Ayres, a stranger would suppose it a most moral
city; we have no drunken disorderly females, creating
abhorrence and disgust. Intrigue is common enough, but
then it is modestly managed: besides, a lady&rsquo;s frailty is not
considered an offence so heinous as in our scrupulous
England; more compassion exists for the lovely sinners.
Here are no crim. con. actions to amuse some amorous
judge and counsel, and inflame the passions.</p>

<p>This country has its portion of beggars, who are, at times,
very annoying, besieging the court-yards, &amp;c. The best
way to get rid of them is to exclaim &ldquo;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Perdone por Dios!</i>&rdquo;
(pardon for God&rsquo;s sake). This expression, singular as it
may appear, seldom fails in its effect; but &ldquo;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Perdone por
Dios!</i>&rdquo; would have but little chance amongst the sturdy beggars
of Europe.</p>

<p>The operation of lousing, so common in old Spain, is followed
here, in a degree, amongst a particular class. It is
a most unseemly sight, for female fingers to perform the
office of combs.</p>

<p>A great aversion used to exist to reside in a house in
which a person had died of a fever, until it was thoroughly
cleaned.</p>

<p>A savings bank has been established, upon the English
plan; I doubt if it will suit the meridian of Buenos Ayres:
they are too careless of to-morrow. If beef was one real
per pound, their ideas would be different; the labourer
would be more industrious, and not refuse to work on a
rainy day, which is the case now. A tolerable sum has
been collected for the savings bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">-&nbsp;70&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>A propensity to gaming exists with the Buenos Ayreans;
I mean with the male part. The vices of London&rsquo;s fashionable
dames, in this respect, are not followed by the fair that
inhabit the banks of La Plata.</p>

<p>There are no houses publicly appropriated for gaming,
the government having discountenanced this: but what can
impede the infatuated gamester? A few nights after my
arrival, I visited a gambling-house; they were playing a
game like those of our E.O. tables. The police entered;&mdash;I
thought they were going to take us all into custody, in the
London mode; but they were more considerate, and only
took the principals: several Englishmen were in the room.
If I am correctly informed, Buenos Ayres contains individuals
who, in the management of the dice-box, might
cope with gentlemen in the parish of St. James, which some
South American deputies, resident in London, can vouch
for.</p>

<p>Even the boys of Buenos Ayres have a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">penchant</i> for
gambling; especially the milk-boys, who often go home
<em>minus</em> the day&rsquo;s receipts.</p>

<p>Bathing in summer by all classes, particularly the ladies,
is one of the fashionable recreations of the place; and as
regards the latter, a stranger is not a little interested; for
here are no Ramsgate, Margate, or Brighton machines, to
shield them from prying eyes. They use bathing clothes,
and the operations of undressing, dressing, &amp;c. are managed
with great dexterity.</p>

<p>They bathe in front of the town, attended by their female
slaves. I have often smiled to see them splashing about the
water, with their hair dishevelled, like a groupe of mermaids,
wanting but the comb and glass to make the picture
perfect. At dark, the scene continues, and not being
exposed to the unhallowed eyes of man, they give a loose
to joy and merriment. Many lanterns are lighted, and the
quantity of them convey an idea of a Chinese festival.
Bathing machines would be a great accommodation, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">-&nbsp;71&nbsp;-</a></span>
is necessary to walk nearly a quarter of a mile to get out of
depth; and, except in some parts, the bottom is stony
and disagreeable. It is altogether a wretched place for
bathing.</p>

<p>Some <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</i> modest persons (foreigners) take
occasion to censure this fashion of the females bathing,
denominating it indecent. The assertion is hardly a
fair one. It has long been the custom; and such is the
circumspection used, that a bathing machine could scarcely
add to the decorum of the scene. Some grotesque scenes
sometimes occur, such as the lower orders of women
bathing and smoking the segar at the same time. Umbrellas
are at times used to shade off the sun. No respectable
person ventures near the place occupied by the bathing
females.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Dress</span>.&mdash;In their attire, the gentlemen of Buenos Ayres
follow the English fashion, except that they have not had
the folly to imitate us in our French short-tailed coats,
which were only worn by porters and oyster-men when I
was in England. From the summer&rsquo;s heat, jackets and
light trowsers are worn, with straw hats, particularly those
singularly shaped ones from Chili. It is not genteel to
wear jackets at the theatre, or at parties. From November
to March, light clothing is very agreeable, except now and
then during some days of cold.</p>

<p>In England, they would smile to see the dress of the
boys in Buenos Ayres; they have long coats, capotes,
large hats, Wellington trowsers, and boots; and this for
children of eight and nine years of age, who look like men
of Lilliput.</p>

<p>The dress of the Buenos Ayrean ladies, I think, includes
all that is charming in female attire. The street dress is
enchanting, equal to that of our ball-room. White is the
prevailing colour. The waist is neither so short as the
French, nor so long as the English. Shawls of all descriptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">-&nbsp;72&nbsp;-</a></span>
are worn; some of them serve both for veil and shawl,
covering the bosom, and hanging loosely over the back part
of the head: the face is never concealed. In fine weather,
they throw the shawl entirely from the head, and walk the
streets in conscious beauty, heedless of the admiring eyes
that will, in spite of resolution, turn to gaze at them, as
fancied beings of another sphere. Many times I have done
this, and found it impossible to withdraw my eyes, till distance,
or the fear of being observed, has obliged me. Those
provoking fair ones wear the frock and petticoat of that
shortness, as just to expose enough of the leg and ancle to
increase the temptation. The persons of some of them are
symmetry itself.</p>

<p>So eager are the Buenos Ayrean ladies to display advantageously
their pretty feet and ancles, that they wear
such tight shoes, as must cause them infinite pain, which is
evident from the limping manner in which they are often
observed to walk.</p>

<p>The ball dress is similar to that worn in the theatre;
there may be more of ornament, but some young ladies
whom I could name want &ldquo;no more diamonds than their
eyes can give.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some ladies change their dress three and four times in a
day.</p>

<p>The greatest attention is paid to the hair, which is suffered
to grow to a considerable length, and is fastened by a
comb behind, with ringlets in the front. Caps or bonnets
are never worn, even in extreme old age. The elderly lady
has her white locks as carefully combed as when in youth;
and the same peculiar style of managing the veil. They
have not recourse to powder, or other disguises, to hide the
approach of age. In company, they are exceedingly free
and talkative, and very cheerful. It is a sight not devoid
of interest, to see them gliding along, in their black attire,
to church, at which they are the most constant visitants&mdash;the
faded forms of what was once, perhaps, so lovely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">-&nbsp;73&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The sable dress worn by the ladies at church, and which
I so much admire, is the ancient Spanish costume, the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">basquina</i>.</p>

<p>The wearing of mourning does not continue so long as
with us; neither are young and handsome widows disfigured
by those close and melancholy-looking caps that we
see in England.</p>

<p>I am so charmed with the costume of the Spanish ladies,
that I begin to think my dislike of the cap and bonnet has
something of prejudice in it. If fortune should conduct
me again to England, it will be some time ere I shall fancy
those articles of dress. In Buenos Ayres, the sight of
them are my perfect abhorrence: at home, they are more
applicable to the climate.</p>

<p>Fans are the ladies constant companions&mdash;in the street,
theatre, ball, and chamber; and their style of using them
is unique, and, I think, graceful. They are expensive: I
have heard of sixty to seventy dollars being given for one.
The French send a great many, with all the embellishments
so peculiar to that nation.</p>

<p>The dress of the female children displays equal taste
with that of their elders; from which, indeed, there is little
difference&mdash;the short-sleeved frock, silk stockings, curled
hair, and fan. They walk the streets with immense importance&mdash;the
miniatures of those of maturer age.</p>

<p>The children of Buenos Ayres are handsome; many of
the female part, perfect seraphs, bidding fair to fill up the
void that time will soon occasion in those whose charms
now so much delight us. I sometimes look at these little
creatures with a feeling almost bordering upon melancholy,
to think that, in a few years, they will replace those who
at this period shine forth in all the heaven of beauty, to
be themselves replaced, another and another race succeeding.
Who can prize life, when our dream of happiness is
so short; the vale of coming years so soon casting its blight
upon all our ardent, youthful fancies?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">-&nbsp;74&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The females are really industrious, making their own
clothes, and, I am informed, the silk shoes they wear:
a British lady is lost without the milliner&rsquo;s aid. One of
that profession might answer here, if it were only for the
novelty of the thing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Travelling</span>.&mdash;Not many carriages or coaches are to be
seen; but they increase in number. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">call&eacute; coch&eacute;</i>, or
street coach, is much used; it is drawn by two horses,
or mules, with a postillion, and in shape very much resembles
our bakers&rsquo; carts: the passengers are seated sideways.
Some English merchants and Creoles have carriages
after the English mode; but the nature of the roads and
streets does not afford them a great opportunity to &ldquo;show
off.&rdquo; Morris, an Englishman, carries on a profitable trade
as coach-maker: he is, indeed, the only good one in the
town.</p>

<p>The travelling carriages, that convey families to their
estates, hundreds of miles distant, are heavy cumbersome
machines, in the old Spanish style. A family going to
the country is no ordinary sight; the mules and waggons
following with the baggage, and the quantity of out-riders,
slaves, and servants, in <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ponchos</i> and little dirty hats, surrounding
the carriages containing the ladies and female
slaves, appear like a banditti escorting their plunder.</p>

<p>A gentleman travelling has dirty white leather boots,
large spurs, poncho, slouching hat, pistols, sword, dagger,
and knife; he appears a complete robber captain&mdash;in fact,
another Rugantino: he has generally one or two slaves to
attend him.</p>

<p>There are post-houses on the road, and those leading to
Chili are very regular. A constant supply of horses and
guides are kept; but persons mostly go on horseback, for
the sake of expedition. The journey is thus made to the
Andes in about fourteen days. Crossing the mountains,
and getting to Santiago, in Chili, will take about three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">-&nbsp;75&nbsp;-</a></span>
weeks, from Buenos Ayres; but the horse must always be
kept at a full gallop. Carriages are expensive, and very
dilatory, but they save a great deal of fatigue.</p>

<p>There are persons in Europe who suppose that horses
may be obtained in South America for the trouble of catching
them: but that is not exactly the case in this province;
here they have all owners.</p>

<p>Horses may be bought from 3 to 100 dollars, according
to their quality; a very good one may be had for seventeen
dollars. They average about 12 or 13 hands high, and
have the tail mostly long. They will endure much fatigue.
Their pace is the gallop, or canter; trotting, the horse&rsquo;s
natural pace, appears quite unnatural here; but we must
not include those trained for the carriage or gig. There are
some fine horses in Buenos Ayres; and by those who have
not seen the hunters, the dray, and the heavy horse of
Europe, they will be admired. To tell a native that horses
have been sold in England for 2, 3, 4, and 5000 guineas,
would hardly gain belief.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> If these animals are cheap here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">-&nbsp;76&nbsp;-</a></span>
the keep of them is dear&mdash;from 12 to 17 dollars per month.
Hay is not much used: grass may be purchased from the
country, every morning, from the grass carts that pass
through the town.</p>

<p>They have no convenience like the livery stables of England.
The horses are put under a shed, or left in the open
air; the mild climate requiring no other care. Those employed
in drudgery with carts, at the custom-house, &amp;c.
are as hard worked as our post and hackney-coach horses.</p>

<p>English saddles are in vogue. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ricado</i>, or saddle of
the country, keeps its sway, being so constructed that on
journeys it serves for saddle and bed. The Spanish bridle
and bit are preferred both by the English and the natives.
The Spanish fashion of having the stirrups long is invariably
followed, and I think it more graceful than our
mode.</p>

<p>Silver stirrups, spurs, &amp;c. are not so much in use as formerly.
Horses, bridles, and saddles were repeatedly stolen
in the streets; but such events, from the regularity of the
police, do not often happen now. Every horse has a burnt
mark, by which its owner can be traced.</p>

<p>The ladies ride on horseback; but they neither look so
well in their riding attire, or manage the horse so dexterously,
as the British ladies.</p>

<p>The lower orders of countrymen ride with one toe in the
stirrup, and gallop for miles in that way.</p>

<p>They strap the front of the horses&rsquo; legs, to prevent their
running away, in the streets. Galloping is not permitted in
the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">-&nbsp;77&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The country waggons are roofed with hides, and have
large wheels: the creaking of the latter is very disagreeable;
but they will not take the trouble to grease them. Whole
families and parties, going long journeys, live and sleep for
weeks or months together in waggons drawn by oxen.
Six or eight of them are yoked, in pairs, to a log of wood
at the back of the horns, to which the rope harness is tied,
and they are thus made to draw the burthen from the head.
They are urged on by poles with a sharp substance at the
end: the drivers have likewise a piece of lead, in shape
and size like our constables&rsquo; staffs, with which they belabour
the poor animal about the horns. They sadly want a
Mr. Martin here. From being so constantly goaded, these
animals have got a mischievous trick of kicking; and, not
being aware of them, I once received a favour of this sort,
which has since made me (to use the sailor&rsquo;s phrase) &ldquo;give
them a wide birth.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Sports and Amusements</span>.&mdash;Near the Recolator is a
decent even road, where, on fine evening, are horse-races.
The natives ride without saddle; and the animals
have great spirit. Englishmen sometimes get up a race,
the natives acting as jockeys.</p>

<p>Exercise on the water is not a popular amusement. The
inhabitants have no taste for sailing-boats and rowing-matches:
the river, it is true, has no very great inducement
for aquatic sports.</p>

<p>A particular class of the people are very fond of cock-fighting,
and will give thirty to forty dollars for a good
English game-cock. The packet sailors have brought
some out, and sold them well. The native game-cocks
are good, but not equal in strength and courage to the
English.</p>

<p>Greyhounds and foxhounds would come to a bad market,
for neither climate nor country is adapted for hunting.
My fox-hunting countrymen would be out of their element<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">-&nbsp;78&nbsp;-</a></span>
here: foxes there are none; but deer are plentiful. Athletic
sports must be confined to countries more congenial
to them.</p>

<p>The amateurs of shooting would be at home: birds
abound so much as almost to destroy the pleasure of the
sport. A short distance from town, there are lakes, with
wild ducks, geese, swans, &amp;c. In cold weather, and in
other periods, flocks fly over the town, and alight near the
beach. The black-necked swans are fine birds; and wild
ducks, which are always an excellent dish at table, are
much better than the tame ones: the market is well supplied
with them. There are also excellent partridges, of a
larger size than our&rsquo;s; but there are no pheasants. English
sportsmen, habited in the mode of their country, with
fustian jacket, gun fastened to the horse, and the dogs
behind, greatly enjoy this recreation: they bring to my
recollection our sporting farmers of Gloucestershire and
Norfolk, revived in South-America. The Frenchmen in
this country are fond of the sport: they go out, dressed in
French sporting costume, with cap and jacket, and on foot.
I have observed that this amusement is, in a great measure,
confined to foreigners; the natives take very little interest
in it. The cockney sportmen of Buenos Ayres sometimes
amuse themselves by shooting gulls on the beach.</p>

<p>The country affords little facility to follow fishing as a
sport; and the fish found in the river, with a few exceptions,
is not worth catching. They fish on horseback. Two
horses are attached, one to each end of the net,&mdash;a man
standing on their backs, in the manner of one of Astley&rsquo;s
equestrians; and they go so deeply in the water, that the
horses are, at times, obliged to swim. I have expected to
see the men thrown off. The net is then hauled to the
shore; the fish that is fit for the market is taken out, and
the rest thrown or given away. People don&rsquo;t go out fishing
at a distance, in boats. The sailors on board the vessels
in the roads catch great quantities of fish, but they are of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">-&nbsp;79&nbsp;-</a></span>
a very indifferent kind: one called the cat-fish is the most
common.</p>

<p>Throwing the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">lasso</i> is a favourite amusement of this
country, and is performed by the natives with great dexterity.
A man on horseback, holding the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">lasso</i> (a rope
looped at the end) rides amongst a herd of cattle, casting
the rope towards the object he wishes to entrap; the first
attempt almost always succeeds, and the animal is fast
secured by the leg. They practice this <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">lasso</i> from boyhood:
it is a formidable weapon, against a flying enemy.</p>

<p>An annual fair is held on some open ground, before the
Recolator church, about two miles from the fort, and one
mile north of the town. It commences on the 12th of October
(the nativity of Nostra Se&ntilde;ora del Pilar)<!--added )-->, and continues
a week. The amusements are not very great: there are a
few booths for eating and drinking, swings, two or three
humourless clowns running about, and a military band.
The national British and American flags are hoisted from
houses and booths devoted to good cheer, rented for the
occasion by individuals of those nations. At night, the
country people dance till a late hour in the booths; they
may be observed to perfection then. I wandered into
several; and the Gaucho ladies and gentlemen behaved with
the greatest politeness, offering me a seat, and entreating
me to dance. The guitar was the music, with the usual
accompaniments of singing, and snapping the fingers during
the dance. On fine evenings a very elegant assemblage
attend this fair, which is a promenade for the beauties of the
city; but being held so near the equinox, the weather
is generally unsettled. In 1822, a tremendous storm took
place, one night of the fair, overwhelming booths, flags, and
preparations; hundreds took refuge in the church. At
the theatre (in which I happened to be during the storm),
the dust filled the interior, obscuring the stage. The small
stones and dust, rattling against the walls and windows,
had the effect of what one might suppose of a shower of
small shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">-&nbsp;80&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The fair at the Recolator, in 1824, as regarded amusements,
was very dull. The promenade, however, was well
attended: the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">elegantes</i>, and others of Buenos Ayres, appeared
in their best attire; and the dashing mulatto girls, in
silk stockings, white dresses, and veils, seemed determined
to rival the fair ones of higher birth. As usual, the equinoctial
gales vented their spite at this devoted fair.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>During Carnival they have a disgusting practice: in place
of music, masques, and dancing, they amuse themselves by
throwing buckets and pans of water from the tops of houses
and windows, sousing every passenger that passes, and following
each other, from house to house, in regular water attacks.
Egg-shells filled with water are also thrown: these
are sold in the streets. The audience, on leaving the
theatre the night before Carnival, get a plentiful salute of
them. It lasts three days; and many persons go out of
town to avoid it, as it is hardly possible to walk the streets
without a ducking. The ladies receive no mercy; neither do
they deserve any, for they take a most active part. Repeatedly,
on passing groups of them, at night, an egg of
water has been adroitly put into my bosom. Those whose
occupations lead them into the street, must expect a wetting.
Strangers seem to join in the sports with great glee. An
English master of a vessel, just arrived, received a bucket
of water. Not being aware of the practice, he took up
bricks, swearing he would break every window in the house.
He could scarcely be pacified. Many persons have been
seriously ill from the effects of Carnival playing. The
newspapers and police have interfered to suppress it,
hitherto, without effect, though it is somewhat lessened.
They follow it as an ancient custom of the country; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">-&nbsp;81&nbsp;-</a></span>
like other absurdities, it will, I suppose, die a natural death.
If the ladies knew how much it detracts from feminine
softness, surely it would be discontinued by them.</p>

<p>In 1825, government seized the opportunity of the victory
in Peru, to devote the three days of Carnival to public rejoicings.
Handbills were accordingly issued, requesting
fathers and masters of families to assist them, and prevent
water-throwing, denominating it &ldquo;disgraceful to a civilized
people.&rdquo; The appeal had, in some degree, the desired effect:
at night, however, the water-playing folks could not resist
indulging in their favourite amusement&mdash;sprinkling the pedestrians
with water from phials; especially in the Plaza,
where, some mischief-loving girls managed to accommodate
me with some of their favours in this way. In time, the
good sense of the people will banish this, as they have
many other of their antique and absurd customs; for instance,
the musical exhibitions during Lent&mdash;a triumph
gained by reason over bigotry and priestcraft.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Provisions</span>.&mdash;The new market, in the centre of the town,
is convenient, and well supplied: soldiers are stationed in
the outlets, to keep order. Beef is sold at three reals the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">arroba</i>, or 25 lb.; mutton, for the whole sheep, six reals.
Veal is not allowed to be killed; and pork is very bad indeed,
and seldom used at table. Turkeys cost from 5 to 7
reals; ducks and fowls, 3&frac12; reals each; partridges and
pigeons, 1&frac12; real the pair: geese are moderate&mdash;3 reals
each. Vegetables are very dear: cabbages, one real; carrots,
green peas, cauliflowers, spinage, &amp;c. in the same
proportion.</p>

<p>Although the chief articles of life are, at first cost, so
cheap, the expense of fire in cooking makes them come
almost, if not quite, as dear as in England. Coals are imported
from England, and are dear.</p>

<p>The beef is good, but much inferior to our&rsquo;s; and their
fashion of always baking it gives it a taste of the charcoal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">-&nbsp;82&nbsp;-</a></span>
and wood, and renders it insipid. They have no idea of
roasting by the spit. Mr. Booth, an Englishman, who keeps
a store, is noted for having dinners in the English style.</p>

<p>In summer, meat will not keep beyond the day, and
cattle are slaughtered in the morning for the day&rsquo;s consumption;
in winter, the night previous. In England,
meat kept two or three days is supposed to eat more tender;
here, it is the reverse&mdash;as report tells me, for I have
never been housekeeper enough to know from experience.</p>

<p>Mutton is indifferent: from some farms, they tell me, good
mutton can be procured, but it has not been my lot to partake
of any of this superior sort. The natives have not
much relish for mutton: sheep were, at one time, of so
little value, that, in the country, they were killed, and used
as fuel for brick-kilns. This has improved, and will continue
to do so, from the number of well-stocked sheep
farms, that now send large droves far into the interior for
sale. Mr. Halsey, an American gentleman, has a large
concern of this nature.</p>

<p>The poultry bought in the market are not of the best
description; they are in general, diminutive and tough.
To have good poultry, it is necessary for persons to fatten
them themselves, or purchase them at farms that can be
depended upon. Ducks are better; the turkeys are large,
and, when properly reared, eat tender; the geese are indifferent.
Partridges are large and tender, and very excellent.
The ordinary poultry, in a manner, live upon
beef, for which they seem to have a peculiar <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">penchant</i>. I
have seen beef and corn placed before turkeys, and they
preferred the former. In a place where so many animals exist
upon beef, the pig, it may be believed, comes in for his
full share. Indeed, all animals, in this country, appear to
live upon beef. The quantity that is wasted would be
most acceptable to the poor in populous Europe.</p>

<p>This country is as famous for the quantity of beef produced,
as the Cape of Good Hope is for sheep. A bullock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">-&nbsp;83&nbsp;-</a></span>
now costs eight dollars, without the hide; formerly, they
could be purchased at ten reals. The hide now sells for
six dollars. Some of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">estancias</i> have from forty to fifty
thousand head of cattle of all classes.</p>

<p>An order exists, that beef is not to be sold at more than
three reals the arroba, at market. The year of 1823 was
one of great drought, and the cattle perished by thousands:
the beef market was in so terrible a condition, that scarcely
any were to be had, and what there was was very bad;
for cattle could not be brought to market, but at a very great
loss to the owners. The impolicy of a fixed price in an
open market, except when monopoly is apprehended, was
fully proved. When any beef came to market, there was
perfect fighting for it with the slaves and servants of families
and others. The poor endured privations with patience:
John Bull would have been more riotous.</p>

<p>Besides the principal market, there are others in different
parts of the town; and beef is sold in carts, that take their
stations in yards and outbuildings, holding a butcher&rsquo;s
shop, the ground serving for block. The first sight of this
operation, so different to the cleanliness and style of English
butcher&rsquo;s shops, is sufficient to disgust a stranger.</p>

<p>Salt, or corned beef, is only to be had good in winter, and
then it is nothing like that we get in England. It is only
at English or American tables this dish is to be seen: the
natives pretend not to understand it; I have seen them,
notwithstanding, partake of a buttock of beef with great
relish.</p>

<p>A beef-steak is so entirely an English dish, that it preserves
in all climates its original name: they may be had
in the coffee-houses here, but, like the French &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bif-tik</i>,&rdquo;
are no great things.</p>

<p>The Gauchos in the country exist upon beef: bread is
a rarity with them. Having no ovens, they are obliged to
roast the beef upon sticks placed lengthwise. I wish they
were under the same necessity in Buenos Ayres; I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">-&nbsp;84&nbsp;-</a></span>
eat it with much better appetite. The true roast beef is
only to be obtained amongst those Gauchos.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carn&eacute; conquiero</i> (beef baked with part of the hide attached),
and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mater ambre</i>, or kill hunger (baked beef, with
sauce <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piquant</i>), is relished by many here; but I am not one
of the number.</p>

<p>The sausages I should like, were it not for the abhorrent
garlic in them.</p>

<p>The dainties of English hams, cheese, potatoes, &amp;c. are
bought at the stores; the two former, at four reals the pound;
the latter, one real: the duties are rather high upon them.
Bottled beer may be purchased at four reals per bottle; and
draught beer may sometimes be had. Articles of the above
description are almost wholly imported from England. The
length of the voyage will not permit our rich English
cheeses to be brought here; consequently, we are deprived
of the luxury of a real &ldquo;Welch rabbit.&rdquo; The Penco
cheese, brought from the district of that name, in Chili,
approaches nearest to our toasting cheese.</p>

<p>Bread is dear: two small loaves (a trifle larger than our
French rolls), one madio. They decrease the size according
to the price of flour. That made of American flour is
the best. They are, at present, entirely dependent upon
foreign importation; and the Americans have taken away
immense sums of money. The corn of the country, from
some unaccountable cause&mdash;a want of attention, or deficient
harvests&mdash;is nothing equal to the demand. They
generally grind the corn at the bakehouses, which, by a
late order, are removed out of town. Mules are employed
in the grinding.</p>

<p>Tea is not much drank by the natives, though more so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">-&nbsp;85&nbsp;-</a></span>
than formerly. In English families, it is, as at home, an
article of the first necessity; it sells here from 1 to 1&frac12; dollar
per lb. Coffee is 3&frac12; reals per lb. Lump sugar, dear
and scarce; that of Havannah and Brazils is used. Chocolate,
from 2&frac12; to 3 reals per lb.</p>

<p>Altogether, living in Buenos Ayres is much more expensive
than in England, without its various comforts.</p>

<p>Here are wines of all sorts, &ldquo;from humble Port to imperial
Tokay,&rdquo; and but little good. Port and Madeira are
retailed at one dollar per bottle; champaigne, a dollar and
a half. Of French and Spanish wines, there are great
quantities. The cheapest and common drink is the wine
of Catalonia, or, as it is denominated, Carlon wine, which
is sold at from two to three reals per bottle, and is far from
an unpleasant beverage. Not much wine is made in the
country; that of Mendoza has a sweet taste, like our homemade
wines.</p>

<p>Beer is only used as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne bouche</i>. Bottled beer has
not that relish to me, that the London draught porter has.
Brandy, gin, and rum, are abundant. The latter arrives
from the Brazils, Havannah, and Isle of France. The good
old Jamaica rum is a scarce commodity. Ca&ntilde;a, a sort of
white brandy, from the Havannah, Brazils, and Spain, and
called Spanish brandy, is much drank, and makes capital
punch.</p>

<p>The vegetables of this country, to my thinking, are not
very enticing. We miss the delicious flavour of the summer
cabbage, large asparagus, and peas, that we have at
home. A good salad, with cucumbers and onions, may be
procured. Turnips are scarce and bad. Indian corn grows
in abundance.</p>

<p>English potatoes are much sought after: the packet sailors
have brought a great many;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and so eager were the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">-&nbsp;86&nbsp;-</a></span>
potatoe merchants to obtain them, that they quarrelled one
with the other, and their disputes were referred to the Consulado,
who must have imbibed strange opinions of the
trading English. All efforts to raise potatoes on this soil
have failed: they are small and insipid. An Englishman,
Mr. Billinghurst, has been endeavouring, some years, to effect
this object without success. Those grown at Monte Video
are something better. In Peru, they are thought equal, if
not superior, to our&rsquo;s: but our islands appear to be their
home.</p>

<p>The peaches in their season, from January to March,
are excellent, and the consumption great, being esteemed
healthy: they are sold in all parts&mdash;in the markets, shops, and
hawked about the streets. From eight to ten can be purchased
for a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">madio</i> (three-pence English money). The
strawberries, apples, pears, cherries, &amp;c. are, for their quality,
not worthy of notice. Grapes are tolerable. Oranges
will not thrive in this climate; and the lemons are very
inferior. Gooseberries, currants, and plums are unknown,
except by name. After all the praises bestowed upon the
fruits grown in tropical and warm climates, they cannot, in
the gross, equal those of others. What have they to compensate
for the green-gage, gooseberries, currants, strawberries,
cherries, apples, pears, and plums of every description?
Travellers must not believe all they hear in
Europe; they will not find the fields and boughs, in South
America, teeming with every species of fruit, free to those
who choose to gather them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In addition to those already noticed, this country produces
very few <small>OTHER ANIMAL OR VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS</small>.
Indeed, persons who wish to send presents to
England are often at a loss what to forward, the country
not producing any great variety, either in the animal or
vegetable world.</p>

<p>The herds of cattle that exist in the Pampas are immense:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">-&nbsp;87&nbsp;-</a></span>
of this we can form a tolerably correct estimate
from annual exports. In one year a million of ox and
cow hides were exported.</p>

<p>Mules are numerous and cheap; they cost from two to
four dollars each. There is a traffic in them, but not very
great, to the Isle of France and West Indies. The expense
of provender and fitting for such a freight, and the
numbers that die during a voyage, lessen the profits considerably;
and vessels will not venture upon each troublesome
shipmates when any thing else offers.</p>

<p>A great many tigers are found up the country, and about
the islands of the river Parana; but they have nothing of
the ferocity or terrific grandeur of the East-Indian tygers:
they are, in fact, more like leopards; and those that I have
seen are not larger than a common sheep dog. They will,
however, often attack individuals; and several have been
devoured by them.</p>

<p>The tiger-cats are plentiful.</p>

<p>Buenos Ayres swarms with dogs, and none of them very
valuable. An English bull-dog would beat fifty such.
They had an abominable practice of sending criminals,
under a guard, into the streets, armed with heavy clubs, for
the purpose of killing the dogs they met with, leaving the
carcases in the street to rot. Many a pet has been
slaughtered this way. Some more humane method might
be devised, to lessen the number of dogs, than this cruel
and disgusting mode: it has been lately discontinued.
Hydrophobia, I conceive, they only know by name, as I
have never heard of any accident from it.</p>

<p>Of the small field animals the nutria, for the sake of its
skin, it the most valuable, and forms a valuable article of
export. They are, in shape, much like rats; but are larger,
and have long front teeth projecting: they are quite harmless.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">armadillo</i> is the South-American hedge-hog, without
the prickly substances they have in Europe: the natives
eat them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">-&nbsp;88&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Here are, also, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">boscatcha</i>, or South-American
badger; and a pretty little animal, like a weasel, which is
often tamed, and runs about the house.</p>

<p>Rats and ants are a great annoyance in this country:
they swarm in the houses, and are very active in their vocations.
The former are not so ferocious as the English
ones, who often, when retreat is cut off, fight most ratfully.
The Buenos Ayres rats are better educated.</p>

<p>The fire-fly, on summer nights, is seen gliding through
the air.</p>

<p>This not being a woody country, the feathered creation
presents very little variety. Here are the canary, cardinal,
common sparrow, owls, &amp;c.</p>

<p>About Paraguay, and where it is more intersected, there
are some beautiful birds, including the parrot and parroquet;
the latter are likewise plentiful on the other side
of the river, in Entre Rios, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23" href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Ostriches are very numerous in the Pampas.</p>

<p>The beautiful and scarce little humming-bird, now and
then, makes its appearance among the lowers. I have
made several efforts to catch them, but without success.</p>

<p>This portion of South America, in the summer of
1824-25, was most seriously annoyed by locusts; the memory
of the oldest inhabitant cannot recollect such a swarm.
The air was darkened, and the ground strewed, with the
millions of those devouring insects: a north wind brought
them down from the Parana, like a snow-storm. The fruit
trees, plants, &amp;c. dreadfully suffered. The inhabitants
have an idea, that, by ringing bells, beating tin saucepans,
and other noises of this description, locusts can be frightened
away. An easterly wind, rain, and cold weather, are, I believe,
their only destroyers. The months of December,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">-&nbsp;89&nbsp;-</a></span>
1824 and January, 1825, were foggy, dry months, the
wind constantly from the north; and, for want of water, a
great mortality took place in the country among the cattle.</p>

<p>Mushrooms and water-cresses are not very plentiful:
they are more found in the neighbourhood of Ensenada;
as are also leeches, for which doctors give a good price.</p>

<p>The flowers reared in this country must likewise yield, in
beauty and sweetness, to our own: we do not see the polyanthus,
moss rose, and many others that strew their beauties
over the British isles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Population</span>.&mdash;The province of Buenos Ayres, which
extends nearly 500 miles in length, with a breadth undefined
(perhaps equal to its length), has only a population
of about 150,000 souls; and Patagonia, which is under the
same government, 1000.</p>

<p>It is estimated, that in the population of Buenos Ayres,
there are five females to one male. If this be correct, some
ladies are likely to come under the horrid list of old maids.
That more female births take place in comparison with
those of Europe cannot be doubted. I know families of
eight, nine, and ten daughters, and perhaps one son. The
causes of such disproportion, I must leave the natural
philosophers to develope.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Trade and Manufactures</span>.&mdash;From its extensive produce,
Buenos Ayres will ever command attention in a mercantile
point of view.</p>

<p>The exports consist of ox hides of all descriptions, horse
hides, horse hair, wool, tallow, nutria skins, horns, chinchilla
skins, salted beef, and silver in hard dollars and bars.</p>

<p>The quantity of European goods annually imported is
very great: I am surprised how they find vent for them.
The cargoes brought from Liverpool, of manufactured
goods, of Manchester, Glasgow, &amp;c. are of considerable
value, often from 70 to 80, and &pound;100,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">-&nbsp;90&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The following is a list of square-rigged merchant vessels
that entered the port of Buenos Ayres in the years 1821,
1822, 1823, and 1824:&mdash;</p>

<p>Under the Portuguese, Brazilian, and Buenos Ayrean
flags, brigs and small craft are daily arriving and sailing
from and to Rio Janeiro, and all parts of the Brazils,
Patagonia, and trading in the River Plate, and up the
rivers of the interior.</p>

<p>A number of American vessels are sold, as well as broken
up, in Buenos Ayres, which, assuming the flag of the
country, trade with Rio Janeiro, Rio Grande, Patagonia,
&amp;c. Many of them are under the command of Englishmen
and North Americans, who, at no great distance of time
will carry the Buenos Ayrean flag to every part of the
world. This country must for some time rely upon
foreigners for their shipping. The population are not
maritimely inclined.</p>

<p>Several persons gain a livelihood by leaving notices, or
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">avisos</i>, of vessels arriving, and their cargoes.</p>

<p>A long report upon the trade of this country has been
drawn up by a committee of British merchants, and presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">-&nbsp;91&nbsp;-</a></span>
to the Consul, extracts from which have appeared
in the English newspapers. Great talent has been exhibited
in the detail and writing of this report, although I
think the picture has been too highly painted.</p>

<p>Should the trade of Paraguay be thrown open to
Buenos Ayres, it will be of great advantage. The present
Governor, Francia, follows the Jesuits&rsquo; system; and Pekin is
not more secluded from the inspection of strangers. Some
unfortunate Englishmen, who ventured there with goods,
had both their persons and property detained, and no satisfactory
intelligence has been received of them. In February,
1823, a memorial was sent to Sir Thomas Hardy, by their
friends in Buenos Ayres, entreating his interference. This
memorial has been forwarded to the British government.
It is surprising that the people of Paraguay, a country
so rich in its natural productions should be quiet under
such severe restrictions. One is led to suppose, from
their passiveness, that they are content with the system.
Francia, however, has lately permitted communication and
trade with the Portuguese in Brazil; Itapua, on the frontiers,
being the dep&ocirc;t town.</p>

<p>They have no regular exchange for the merchants to meet
in, at Buenos Ayres. A new general Commercial Room
is about to be established, to which persons of all nations
will be allowed to subscribe. Some late regulations of the
British Room have given offence; the committee of which,
in derision, have been named &ldquo;the Holy Alliance,&rdquo; and have
had several anonymous letters addressed to them, upon their
aristocratical notions in a foreign country. The refusal to
allow any but British subjects to subscribe to the Commercial
Room, has been much commented upon; some years
back it might have been advisable, but at this period a
more liberal system would perhaps be better.</p>

<p>The Creoles of the country now engage in mercantile
pursuits with great avidity; and commerce has spread into
so many hands, that money does not roll in quite so fast
as formerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">-&nbsp;92&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The competition amongst the store-keepers materially
diminishes their profits, and reduces the concern upon a
level with English chandlers&rsquo; shops.</p>

<p>The number of shops in Buenos Ayres is very great;
they abound in the streets leading from the Plaza. Every
shop and house has a proportion of taxes levied upon it:
and there is also a species of property tax upon the English
plan. The taxes now imposed considerably diminish the
profits they used to make.</p>

<p>The linen-drapers have a choice assortment from all countries,
neatly arranged. Their shops are well lighted; and although
they fall very short of the splendour of the London
ones, yet they are equal to some of those of our best country
towns: they are open till nine and ten at night. They
call the Buenos Ayreans a lazy people: the shopkeepers,
at least, do not merit this epithet.</p>

<p>The shopmen are mostly young men, who appear to have
all the persuasive arts of their brethren in London, prevailing
upon their fair customers to get rid of their money, and
subjecting them to a good scolding from husbands and
mammas, for extravagance, leading to pouting and sulks
for a week. Those gentlemen of the shop have a great
deal to answer for.</p>

<p>Every article of apparel, both for male and female, can
be purchased at the retail shops, of which there are many:
they have coats, waistcoats, trowsers, &amp;c. hanging in front,
in the mode of Monmouth Street. Mr. Niblett was the
first Englishman that opened a shop of this description.<!--added .-->
A great many Englishmen have their clothes sent from
England: but the duty and incidental expences make them
come as dear as if made here.</p>

<p>Buenos Ayres contains several English tailors, whose
work is tolerably well, considering they have not English
workmen; although not with that exquisite finish which is
to be seen in London. A coat will cost thirty dollars,
trowsers twelve; the rest in proportion. The town swarms
with Creolian and other tailors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">-&nbsp;93&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Manufactories for hats exist in Buenos Ayres: one of
them, Varangot&rsquo;s, has a considerable trade, and they are
really good, from seven to eight dollars each, far superior
to our second-rate hats; the misfortune is, that on the
approach of rainy weather they act as a perfect barometer,
and get limp.</p>

<p>Of the hats imported into Buenos Ayres the English are
preferred; but the heavy duty has brought out those of an
inferior description. At present, there are some good ones
at ten or twelve dollars each, which at that price meet with
a ready sale. The French import a quantity of hats; but
the quality of them is much inferior to our&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>English manufactured goods are cheap; the market has
been overstocked, and, I fear, does not yield much profit
to the adventurers. I have bought English stockings
cheaper than I could buy them in London, leather gloves
(a good pair) for a dollar. It is cheaper to purchase a
stock of linen here than at home. I have purchased good
white cotton neckcloths, after the rate of sixpence each.
In summer, cotton shirting is preferred.</p>

<p>English saddles and bridles are imported largely; we
thus return them their own hides, manufactured into choice
and costly goods. Of the many saddlers&rsquo; shops, several are
kept by Englishmen; as also watch-makers, with loads of
English watches.</p>

<p>All sorts of hardware, as knives and forks, and scissars,
are imported from England, and can be obtained at a
cheap rate; also furniture, such as tables, chairs, &amp;c. Of
the latter, the North Americans bring great quantities.</p>

<p>India goods are sought after, particularly the China
crape shawls.</p>

<p>Articles of stationery arrive from every quarter: Spanish
writing-paper from Gibraltar and the Mediterranean, and
I think it of better quality than ours, at least more pleasant
to write upon.</p>

<p>Barbers&rsquo; shops are in great abundance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">-&nbsp;94&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>At the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pulperias</i>, or grog-shops, they sell almost every
article of life; they are, indeed, perfect chandlers&rsquo; shops.</p>

<p>The pastrycooks neither cut a figure in their shops, nor
in the articles they sell; here are no hot buns or tarts on
a morning, nor stale pastry for the ragamuffin boys to
purchase. Sweetmeats are the order of the day.</p>

<p>A pastrycook&rsquo;s shop in the English style, I am confident,
would succeed&mdash;with the addition of hot rolls in the
morning: none of those luxuries are known here.</p>

<p>A good portrait-painter, I conceive, would meet with
encouragement in Buenos Ayres: at any rate they would
have a fine field for study. An English artist, named
Herv&eacute;, practised some months: indisposition forced him
to leave.</p>

<p>It had occurred to me, that a pawnbroker would be a
good business in Buenos Ayres; but I find every shopkeeper,
or monied person acts in that capacity, and that
respectable persons do not hesitate to send silver spoons,
matt&eacute;-pots, and other valuables, to pledge from day to day&mdash;at
what interest (or if any) I know not, though I am apprehensive
some of them are guilty of what we should call
usury. Poverty is a crime in England; here they dread
not exposure: but such is my delicacy in money affairs, I
should prefer being under an obligation to the gentlemen
with three balls, and to slide in at one of their secret doors,
to the publicity practised here.</p>

<p>An Englishman has lately undertaken a speculation
which has cost him a considerable sum, to have the exclusive
privilege of taking cattle in the Falkland islands&mdash;in fact,
to be sole proprietor for a term of years. He has forwarded
to his new sovereignty a small colony of settlers,
servants, &amp;c.; the chances of his success are very doubtful.
Buenos Ayres claims the jurisdiction of these islands,
and those claims will not cause such a dispute as in the
year 1770. The voyage to them from Buenos Ayres is
made in about fourteen days.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">-&nbsp;95&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Currency</span>, &amp;c.&mdash;In the year 1822 silver became so
scarce, that, it was impossible to get change of a doubloon
without allowing a consideration for it. Foreigners, of
course, bore the blame of draining the country of the
money. To remedy the evil, small notes were issued;
and, shortly after, a large supply of copper coin arrived,
that had been contracted for in England. This currency
of paper and copper was something so new, that not a
few sneers and forebodings took place. The facility that
paper money affords to business, however, soon began
to be experienced in Buenos Ayres. Previous to its
issue, if a person had to receive a hundred dollars,
it was necessary to hire a porter to carry it, and for
larger quantities a cart; besides the endless trouble of
counting thousands of dollars, often in reals and madios,
and the detection of bad money: hours and days of
valuable time were consumed by it. The collecting clerks
are no longer tormented with counting piles of silver,
before they take it from the house. Saturdays are the
days appropriated for money collecting.</p>

<p>Notes, engraved in England, are now issued on a grand
scale, from 5 to 1000 dollars, upon the security of the
government and bank; the people are reconciled to it,
and begin to find that a currency of gold and silver is
not at all times a proof of the credit or riches of a
nation.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Besides the above notes, the present currency consists
of the doubloon of 17 dollars; the half, quarter, and half-quarter
doubloon; the dollar, half dollar, and quarter
dollar; with reals, madios, and quartillos. The hard dollars
are scarce, being bought up for exportation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">-&nbsp;96&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>In exporting money, there is a small duty of two per
cent. to pay. Being so trifling, it prevents smuggling,
which was formerly the case. Making returns in produce,
however, is at all times preferred to money, when it can be
obtained at any thing like a moderate rate; but it is at
times so scarce and dear, that it renders the purchasing
ruinous.</p>

<p>The average exchange for the last three years has been
forty-five pence the Spanish dollar.</p>

<p>The Bank of Buenos Ayres opened in 1822, the first
thing of the sort in this province. Its capital is one
million of dollars, in 1000 shares, of 1000 dollars each.
The number of directors are ten, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i> six Creolian gentlemen,
and four British. It has hitherto proved a profitable
concern. The Bank shares rose from par to 170, but
quickly declined to 90 and 100 per cent. premium, at which
price they seem stationary. The last dividend paid on
Bank stock was after the rate of 30 per cent.</p>

<p>The reported establishment of a National Bank, has
created some alarm, amongst the present Bank proprietors;
numerous controversies have taken place in the newspapers,
upon the occasion. The affair, however, seems at
rest for the present.</p>

<p>The government funds of Buenos Ayres have lately had
a considerable rise, from 28 to 100. The bulls carry all
before them; and the bears have had to pay pretty handsomely.
Who knows but a Stock Exchange may be
established here some years hence?</p>

<p>Considerable sums of money have been made by the
advance in the public funds in Buenos Ayres; and, from
the eagerness of all classes to speculate in them, it is probable
that lame ducks will not be confined to Capel Court.
Every shopkeeper now dabbles in the funds; and, in a
market so confined, the mischief may be very serious.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">-&nbsp;97&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Education, and Literature</span>.&mdash;The government expresses
the most laudable anxiety to forward education,
by patronizing schools upon the Lancasterian system;
and the numerous seminaries in this city are a credit to
the people.</p>

<p>The College School consists of 125 youths, from the
age of 15 to 16 or 17 years of age. In their walks, they
wear black clothes, with a light blue ribbon over their
coat. Their behaviour is better than that of the boys at
our public schools: a person may mix amongst them,
without being subject to those insolent remarks so common
at home, and which makes a stranger dread to enter
their precincts.</p>

<p>At the Buenos Ayres College, pupils are taught every
branch of the classics. They have not the advantage of
professors, as at Oxford, Cambridge, Eton, Westminster, and
the rest of our public schools&mdash;professors, whose talents not
only confer honour upon their country, but on the human
species generally. Some students have elicited considerable
talents. A younger branch of the Belgrano family, Manuel,
wrote a play founded on <cite>The Virgin of the Sun</cite>, which was
performed with success; he has likewise acquired a knowledge
of the English language, and is at present employed
in the British Consul&rsquo;s office.</p>

<p>In the Merced Church, an academy is held for the
instruction of 30 youths in the study of divinity.</p>

<p>Among the numerous seminaries here, is one kept by
an English lady, Mrs. Hyne, which receives great encouragement;
she has had 70 scholars at a time, who
are taught, with other requisites, the English language.
From the anxiety expressed by parents, that their children
should attain this language, the next generation will
become completely anglicised. In placing them under
the care of a Protestant lady, they are not so narrow-minded
as to fear that their religion will be tampered with.
One of the stripling scholars conversed with me the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">-&nbsp;98&nbsp;-</a></span>
day in good English, which he had learned in a very short
period.</p>

<p>A number of Buenos Ayrean gentlemen speak and
write the English language with much fluency and correctness.
Don Manuel Sarratea, late a governor of the province,
and who resided some time in London as their
minister, is a proficient, and a man of talent. To the
British he is very attentive, and is much respected by them.
Don Miguel Riglos is another instance: this gentleman
has made the tour of Great Britain, and speaks English
with so little of foreign accent, that, on my introduction
to him, I supposed him to be an Englishman: his manners
are very prepossessing and amiable. Some self-taught
young men have also an excellent idea of it, and others
express a great desire to learn it. It has now become a
branch of education in their public schools; and, from
the continued intercourse they are likely to have with the
British and North Americans, and others who speak
the English tongue, the utility of learning it will become
every day more apparent, and, as regards business, it will
be of greater importance than the French.</p>

<p>The prejudices of ages is fast wearing away: the South-Americans,
and, Spain herself, no longer view us as
renegades, heretics, &ldquo;God-abandoned.&rdquo; Twenty years
back, England and Englishmen were as little known
or understood by the Buenos Ayreans, as is the interior
of the Chinese empire now to the rest of the world.
For centuries past, care was taken to inflame the passions
of the Spaniards against us and our country; and it is
not strange that a remnant of this animosity yet remains.
Their best poets have stigmatised us: I recollect hearing,
in Buenos Ayres, that part of Lope de Vegas&rsquo; popular
ballad&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;My brother Don John to England&rsquo;s gone,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To kill the Drake, the Queen to take,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And the heretics all to destroy;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And he shall bring you a Protestant maid</span><br />
<span class="i0">To be your slave, &amp;c.&rdquo;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">-&nbsp;99&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>It is gratifying to observe, that those Creolians who have
been in England evince the greatest attachment to us.</p>

<p>In the college of Stonyhurst, near Liverpool, are
several Buenos Ayrean youths, who have been sent
thither to be educated. The British government deserves
praise for the countenance given to this establishment;
silencing at once the complaints of our own Catholics, in
not having a proper place to educate their sons, and
bringing the youth of foreign nations in contact with
our&rsquo;s, from whence it is natural to expect they will feel
an attachment to a country where they have received
almost their first impressions. So far from its infecting
our population with Catholicism,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> the reverse would seem
more probable. It will give strangers an opportunity of
judging, from actual observation, of the institutions of
our country, and the advantages arising from a liberal
system of government.</p>

<p>The education bestowed upon females is far from being
solid: reading, writing, music, and dancing, are all that
is thought necessary. In the two last they are enthusiasts,
and some of the proficients; the study of languages, or
deep reading, is not thought of consequence. Spanish
husbands, they say, have an antipathy to blue-stocking
wives: from the natural talent of the females, they would
soon be adepts in more abstruse studies.</p>

<p>If the Buenos Ayrean ladies do not possess the higher
branches of learning, they have an indescribable sweetness
of manners, free from affectation, at once giving confidence
to the timid stranger, and delightful to all who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">-&nbsp;100&nbsp;-</a></span>
have the happiness to know them. They seldom address
a person but with a smile, listen attentively to conversation,
without that listless indifference, and answering with the
monosyllables of <i>yes</i> and <i>no</i>, that I have witnessed in some
societies.</p>

<p>The time may arrive, when South America may have
to boast her Madame de Staels and a host of female
literati; and another Corinna may conduct her lover
over Southern scenery, the snow-topt Andes, and Imperial
Cusco, with as much soft enthusiasm as belongs to her
Italian rival. At present, however, their natural talent is
thrown into the shade, for want of cultivation.</p>

<p>The letter-writing between female friends is very
energetic: I caught a glimpse of one, which ran thus&mdash;&ldquo;Farewell,
my idolized and beloved friend! receive the
heart of your devoted, constant, faithful, &amp;c.&rdquo; Notwithstanding
this fervour, we never hear of those fatal love
attachments that end so tragically with us: is it that,
south of the line, the female heart is so tenderly moulded,
they will not bid the despairing lover die? or, are they
convinced, &ldquo;that men have died, and worms have eaten
them, but not for love,&rdquo; and therefore doubt the truth of
man&rsquo;s protestations? Alas! I fear that, in this love-inspiring
city of Buenos Ayres, it is possible to find Violas and
Rosalinds, but not many Juliets, and of the other sex
still fewer Werters.</p>

<p>The Spanish language is certainly delightful; its very
sounds bring to recollection the Don Guzmans and Don
Antonios of chivalric days. I wish they would make it the
fashionable study in England, as in good queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s
reign, instead of the trifling French. From the great
changes in the Spanish world, and our South-American
connections, it must ever be an object of importance.</p>

<p>A work published in London, by Mr. Ackerman, in the
Spanish language, with plates, called <cite lang="es" xml:lang="es">Variedades et Mensagero
de Londres</cite>, has numerous purchasers here. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">-&nbsp;101&nbsp;-</a></span>
published quarterly, and reflects great credit on its author.
This publication will afford to the South Americans an
excellent idea of Great Britain and Europe generally;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> it
contains selections from our best authors.</p>

<p>The <small>NEWSPAPERS</small> published in Buenos Ayres are,
the <cite>Argus</cite>, <cite lang="es" xml:lang="es">Teatro del Opinion</cite>,
<cite lang="es" xml:lang="es">Republicano</cite>, and <cite>State
Register</cite>. There was, likewise, a Sunday paper, called
the <cite>Centinella</cite>, which has been discontinued&mdash;for what
reason I know not, for it was managed with ability. The
freedom of the press may be said to exist in a degree here;
to the same extent as in England, would be dangerous at
present.</p>

<p>The <cite>Mercantile Gazette</cite>, edited by Mr. Hallet, a North-American
gentleman, is very useful; it has every sort of
commercial information. A newspaper of the same description,
the <cite lang="es" xml:lang="es">Diario</cite>, carried on by a Portuguese, failed
for want of requisite attention.</p>

<p>A number of ephemeral productions appear from time
to time, &ldquo;to fret and strut their hour upon the stage, and
then are heard no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the almanack of 1824, there is a selection of English
puns and Joe Miller&rsquo;s jests, to amuse the Buenos Ayreans,
and give them a specimen of English low wit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <small>PRINTING-OFFICES</small> are spacious, and furnished with
every requisite, from London. An English printer, Mr.
Cook, is employed in one of the offices, and report states
his professional talents to be of the first order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">-&nbsp;102&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Religion.</span>&mdash;Previous to the late treaty with Great
Britain, no other place of public worship was allowed in
Buenos Ayres, except those of the Romish church; and it
was only after much discussion, that the article allowing
religious toleration was obtained.</p>

<p>The Catholic faith has been denominated a religion of
the fancy; the Protestant, one of the mind. A book I
have lately read, Blunt&rsquo;s <cite>Italy</cite>, ingeniously endeavours to
prove that most of the Catholic ceremonies are remnants
of Paganism; and the author illustrates his arguments by
comparing the Roman with the Popish festivals. The great
similarity would certainly incline one to give credence to the
assertion. The reformed church, however, has its incongruities
likewise. In Buenos Ayres I have not witnessed
any thing like the superstition that reigns in Belgium;
bigots there are, but not more than in some of our sects
at home. The rising generation of Buenos Ayres have
gone from one extreme to another, and are quite Voltairians:
at the theatre, during a portrait exhibition of different
public characters, that of Voltaire ran away with all the
applause.</p>

<p>In January, 1824, an archbishop, named Don Juan Muzi,
arrived from Rome with a large suite, in a Sardinian brig,
which hoisted the Papal flag in addition to her own, and fired
a salute. Some time ago, such an event would have put
the whole town in commotion; as it was, few attended to
see him land, and his reception by the government was
any thing but cordial: he shortly after departed for Chili.
During his abode, he lodged at Faunch&rsquo;s Hotel, and there
gave his benedictions to the crowds that visited him, who
were mostly females, attracted, I thought, more from curiosity
than from any other motive. The manifest of the
archbishop&rsquo;s effects raised a smile:&mdash;there were beads,
crosses, and every trifling appendage of the church. The
archbishop himself, from his venerable aspect and mild
manners, engaged the esteem of all; but the Papal power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">-&nbsp;103&nbsp;-</a></span>
is on the wane here now, whatever it might have been in
other times. The Catholic church, however, under the
care of a liberal priesthood, and shorn of its superstitions,
will insure the respect of all countries.</p>

<p>A church, in Catholic countries, ever possesses something
to strike the eye, though there may not be service
going on. There are generally to be seen numbers of poor
old women, before their saint, counting their beads, the low
murmurings of their prayers alone breathing the silence of
the place: many times have I advanced with cautious steps,
fearing to interrupt their devotions. The absence of a
congregation gives one, likewise, an opportunity of a closer
inspection of the glittering altars, virgins, saints, and Madonas.
No fear exists that sacrilegious hands would dare
purloin any thing from the sacred walls; alas! in England,
our thieves would not be so scrupulous.</p>

<p>The churches, on a Sunday, or feast day, are worthy a
stranger&rsquo;s attention; and he must be cold indeed, that can
view such an assemblage of beauty unmoved: the dress,
the veil, and prostrate persons; indeed, we might picture
other Lauras besides Petrarch&rsquo;s: it is almost enough to
make one turn renegade, forsake the religion of our fathers,
and rush into the bosom of a church so enchanting.</p>

<p>Public worship takes place at various hours: one mass,
as early as six in the morning, and the sweet girls and their
mothers are seen hurrying to church at that early hour.</p>

<p>Families going to mass are attended by slaves and servants
carrying the carpeting upon which they kneel. Of
books they have few enough; and would, I dare say, stare
to see our London footmen, in gorgeous liveries, looking
like Austrian field-marshals, walking behind their mistresses,
with a load of books, to church, and the host of carriages
that attend a fashionable chapel.</p>

<p>Upon entering or leaving a church, many of the congregation
are content to receive the holy water at second hand;
that is to say, one who is near the vessel which contains it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">-&nbsp;104&nbsp;-</a></span>
will dip his fingers in, and furnish to three or four other
persons drops of the sacred element, to make the sign of
the cross. The ladies often condescend to mark with this
water the foreheads of their female slaves and attendants.</p>

<p>At &ldquo;oration time,&rdquo; in the dusk of evening, a small bell
tingles from the churches, when, it is presumed, every true
Catholic whispers a prayer. In Buenos Ayres, I am afraid,
this is not always the case.</p>

<p>Some of the music sung in the masses is very pretty:
friars and boys are the vocalists, selected from the best
voices. Friar Juan, at the Cathedral, has a fine bass voice.
The Portuguese hymn they sing with science; but, as I had
heard this hymn at the Portuguese Ambassador&rsquo;s Chapel
in London, in which several of the first-rates of the Opera
took parts, the effect here was diminished: they select,
too, from profane music, and I applaud them for it, following
the remark attributed to our Rev. Rowland Hill, on
the introduction of &ldquo;Rule Britannia,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hearts of
Oak,&rdquo; into his chapel&mdash;&ldquo;It is really a great shame the
devil should have all the pretty tunes to himself.&rdquo; If
music be the &ldquo;food of love,&rdquo; it is equally so of religion, insensibly
leading the mind to an enthusiasm, and that softness,
that compensates for &ldquo;a dull age of pain.&rdquo; I wish
they would reform the dismal hum-drum music of our
English churches. I do not wish the lively dance; but
something a little less gloomy than the present mode. My
English friends will be shocked to hear that in a Buenos
Ayres church they have played and sung to the charming
air that opens our petit opera of <cite>Paul and Virginia</cite>, &ldquo;See
from ocean rising.&rdquo; At Monte Video, I heard the Tyrolean
war song, or our &ldquo;Merrily O,&rdquo; upon the organ, in a
church. Music and religion have, and will, raise these
people to war and desperation; other causes must combine
to have the same effect upon Englishmen.</p>

<p>Persons of both sexes go to confession very young&mdash;even
at the early age of ten years. At church confessions, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">-&nbsp;105&nbsp;-</a></span>
priest is seated in the box, to which there is an iron-grating
on one side, and through this he hears the confession of the
parties upon their knees outside. I have seen several women
confess;&mdash;somehow or other the sex have more devotion
than us men. Doubtless, it is a relief to the overcharged
heart to unbosom itself, and receive the consolations of
religion; and I can fancy the happiness experienced from
the gentle expostulations of an amiable priest, who, in
censuring the errors, bids the sinner not despair of mercy.
We, of Protestant creed, appeal to God alone, disdaining
earthly interference. This system of divulging our inmost
thoughts has, at all times, been an argument with the opponents
of the Romish church, who instance, that the
peace of families or nations are at the mercy of a mortal
man; and if breaches of confidence are rare, still some
villain might betray his trust, and ruin his unsuspecting
victims. To the honour of the Catholic priesthood, such
probabilities are very remote. I am afraid that I should
make a sad father confessor: loveliness upon the bended
knee before me would destroy all my philosophy; I should
at once accord them absolution, remission, and every thing
else; and, forgetful of my oaths and sacred calling, turn
suppliant at the feet of those who came to me as their pastor
and guide.</p>

<p>Females are at times seen in the streets habited as nuns,
in flannel vestments, crosses, beads, &amp;c. the effect of a
vow made during sickness or penance. The sins of some
of these young creatures cannot have been very flagrant:
I should have pardoned them for the pleasure of receiving
their confessions again. There is likewise a house in which
females pass weeks in penitence and prayer.</p>

<p>It is observed of the Spanish female, that she will give
herself up to all the voluptuousness of pleasure, haste to
the church, and, prostrating herself before her favourite
saint, return to sin again. I will not venture to be so
severe a censurer as to hazard an opinion upon this: but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">-&nbsp;106&nbsp;-</a></span>
as my eye wandered over the countenances of many a fair
creature of Buenos Ayres, kneeling in graceful beauty before
the inanimate saint, I fancied all and more than books
had ever told me; for, &ldquo;with faces that seemed as if they
had just looked in Paradise, and caught its early beauty,&rdquo;
I fancied that many of earthly mould shared in those contemplations
so seemingly devoted to heaven.</p>

<p>Small figures of the Virgin Mary, in glass cases, are kept
in the apartments of various homes. In apothecaries&rsquo;
shops I have particularly noticed them, to bespeak a
blessing, doubtless, upon their physic. In the mansions
of the poorer class they are more frequently seen; the
costly saint and miserable dirty furniture of the rooms
contrasted. A full-length figure of a saint, in a wire cage,
with lamps on each side, is in the street of Le Cuyo, placed
in accordance with a vow made in a period of danger; but,
in general, there are less externals of the church in the
public streets and roads than might be expected.</p>

<p>On passing a church, it was a constant custom to take
off the hat; but few do it now. The beggars about these
holy edifices clamour for charity, for the love of God and
St. Rosario, or any other apostle favourite. These beggars
are great thieves; I have lost several articles by their
professional visits to my lodgings. They do not shoulder
crutches and wooden legs, either to fight or run, as their
London brethren, upon the approach of the police. One
of my friends told me of an old woman, in Buenos Ayres,
that spits upon every person she supposes to be an Englishman.
Not having had the fortune to receive this lady&rsquo;s
favours, I cannot vouch for the truth of the story.</p>

<p>The priesthood are not so illiberal as report makes them
out; they are painted to us as having a fixed hatred to
Protestants, conceiving them to be the authors of all the
obloquy the Catholics have endured from time to time. It
must be recollected, that we have our errors on the score of
prejudice likewise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">-&nbsp;107&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The friars of Buenos Ayres have amongst their body
men of considerable learning; and, whatever hostility exists
towards the system, they, as individuals, do not generally
share in it. There may be one or two black sheep in
the flock; and scandal takes care to blazen forth their
deeds, particularly all that relates to their amours, but
the common frailty of our nature should teach us to be
merciful judges where love is concerned. The people
have much respect for them; and, from what I have heard,
they deserve it. Formerly, it is related, that on any offender
being flogged in the public streets, the appearance of
a priest calling for mercy would stop the infliction. If this
was the case in England, our unflogged thieves would be
bound to pray for them.</p>

<p>Four years since, two Englishmen having quarrelled, one
of them ran into Le Merced church for protection from his
opponent, who followed, and beat him under the very robes
of the priest; a guard was called, and the offender taken
into custody. Having an excellent character, he was
liberated from prison on bail; and the affair ended in an
expensive law suit. Some years back, he would have been
severely punished for his inconsiderate conduct.</p>

<p>Some of the friars are handsome men: I have remarked
one of them a counterpart of Young the actor. Their
dress, shaven crown, and dark hair, added much to their
appearance: the ugly attire they now wear, is a sad
drawback. In my casual rencontres with them, I ever
found them polite and attentive, effacing that diffidence
which a stranger feels in venturing upon their hallowed
precincts. The inquisition has never been established in
Buenos Ayres; but I have often been cruel enough to fancy,
that such and such a priest had a countenance like an
inquisitor.</p>

<p>The suppression of the monasteries, in 1822, caused a great
deal of discussion. There were those of the well-inclined who
were not without apprehensions, and seemed disposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">-&nbsp;108&nbsp;-</a></span>
let the presumed evil continue, rather than risk a change.
The government must have felt their own strength, when
they determined to reform so influential a portion of the
church, having to encounter the prejudices and fanaticism
of those grown grey in the old order of things, who regarded
meddling with the church as little short of heresy.
The friars were, in a manner, domesticated with the first
families of Buenos Ayres, and ever received as welcome
guests. They must (at least, some of them) have felt great
reluctance to quit the convents, in which they had expected
to remain for life, and regret at parting with the attire of
their order. Discontent was engendered, at times, almost
amounting to threats, which found vent in a conspiracy,
ending in the banishment of Tagl&eacute;, its author; and another
more serious one, of the 19th March, 1823. The result of
these abortive attempts served to confirm the power and
influence of the existing government. The majority of the
people, I should conceive, thought an alteration necessary
in the clergy: many of that majority had visited Europe,
and became divested of the narrow policy the Spaniards
had taught them.</p>

<p>Elderly ladies, of all countries, are allowed to be more
pious than the rest of society. The friars in Buenos Ayres
found them staunch advocates of their cause.</p>

<p>To counteract the strong feeling that existed for the
friars, the press of the day had recourse to ridicule, as well
as to argument: a publication called the &ldquo;<cite lang="es" xml:lang="es">Llobera</cite>,&rdquo;
teemed with paragraphs and anecdotes, often so indecent
that it injured the cause it proposed to serve. This print
was soon laid aside. In the mean time, the suppression
gradually went on; and all that now remains of the monasteries
of Buenos Ayres are the Franciscans. The buildings
will soon perhaps be converted to other uses. The
ejected friars, throwing off their habit, assumed a clerical
half-dress, very similar to that of our clergymen; and the
Dominicans, Mercedites, &amp;c. are now met in the streets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">-&nbsp;109&nbsp;-</a></span>
as simple citizens, no longer wearing the livery of the
founders of those orders. Three years ago, groupes of
friars were continually about the church doors, in coffee-houses,
and the streets, segar smoking, apparently under no
church restrictions: when a reform was agitated, they were
more strict, and the convent gates were closed at a certain
hour. The Franciscans, who yet keep together, are rarely
to be seen abroad, except the messengers, or lay brothers,
who are, in dress and figure, no bad copy of their prototype,
in <cite>The Duenna</cite>.</p>

<p>If the original rules of monastic institutions were put in
full force, few claimants would be found for the honour of
entering them. A suitable provision has been made for
those who have left their convents; the government appropriating
the lands attached for the benefit of the state.
Time appears, in some measure, to have healed the wounds
of the discontented, though there are some who pretend
the flame is smothered, and not burnt out; &ldquo;Give it vent,&rdquo;
they say, &ldquo;and &rsquo;twill blaze again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are two convents for <small>NUNS</small>, St. Juan and St.
Catalina, each containing about thirty. The regulations of
St. Juan&rsquo;s are very rigid: they wear clothing of the coarsest
nature, and the beds, and every other accommodation, are
of the same description. No one is permitted to see them,
except their nearest relations, and that very rarely.
Heavens! how ardent must be that devotion, that can
voluntarily embrace such a life! A female, on her first
entrance, may leave at the end of a year; but, after that
time, she is professed, and must conform to the rules. Very
few, I believe, take advantage of this option. Such is the
force of religious enthusiasm, that they gladly bid farewell
to the world, wishing no father, mother, lover, friend, but
their God and Saviour.</p>

<p>At St. Catalina&rsquo;s they are not so strict, being allowed
indulgences unknown to the self-immolated of St. Juan.</p>

<p>I have never seen any of the fair inhabitants of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">-&nbsp;110&nbsp;-</a></span>
convents; but when the nuns of Buenos Ayres have formed
the subject of conversation, I have eagerly listened, expecting
to hear something of disappointed love, or confidence
betrayed. Alas it was in vain: the ladies of St. Juan and
Catalina are nuns from the dull routine of religion, with
one exception only, if my information is true; and advantage
was not taken to quiz my avidity for nunnery news.
The tale runs, that St. Juan&rsquo;s convent does contain, a victim
of &ldquo;despised love.&rdquo; Her lover, an officer, of course&mdash;for
what men in trade ever think of love?&mdash;joined the army
in Peru, and married another. At the age of seventeen,
the fair, betrayed girl fearlessly took the veil, chiding her
weeping mother for her cruelty, nay, sinfulness, at shewing
such affliction for what constituted her daughter&rsquo;s only happiness.
An account of the ceremony was given me;&mdash;but
who shall take the field in description, after the glowing
details we have read in romances? and especially at second-hand.</p>

<p>The majority of the nuns in these two convents are aged,
having received very few additions, lately, of the youthful
class. Has man, false man, become more constant, no
longer striving to break the heart of the doting fair one
or, are the ladies less sensitive, preferring, at all hazards,
this bustling world to the cloister&rsquo;s gloom, exclaiming
with Sheridan&rsquo;s <i>Clara</i>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Adieu, thou dreary pile, where never dies</span><br />
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The sullen echo of repentant sighs!&rdquo;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>In the most minute affairs of the Romish church, there is
a formula, which, having antiquity for its basis, imposes
upon the mind of its followers; and, as regards a conventual
life, the first dawn of such a wish, even before the
parties quit their parents&rsquo; house, amounts to a ceremony.
In the year 1822, my curiosity was gratified by an exhibition
of this sort. I was invited to a house, in which a lady,
about to become a nun, was receiving the last farewells of
her friends. It was evening; and it was with difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">-&nbsp;111&nbsp;-</a></span>
that I gained admittance from the crowd outside. The
lady was seated in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sala</i>; arrayed in her best attire; her
head and neck decorated with jewellery; such is the
fashion, this being a contrast to the dress she was about to
assume. Music was heard; and it seemed more like a
party met for gaiety, than one in which the afterpiece was
to be so serious&mdash;the taking from the world a fellow-creature.
The lady&mdash;I was going to write, victim&mdash;was all smiles;
no regrets were apparent in her bosom; she received the
adieus of her friends with calm composure. A friar, attached
perhaps to the convent, was in the room: in
taking her final leave, she was escorted by him and her
relatives. With a firm step, bowing to all around, she
quitted the room. In passing our party (consisting of
several Englishmen), I thought she eyed us particularly;
we bowed to her; and the door closed upon us. That
same night, I am informed, she was conducted to the gloomy
walls of St. Juan, and has since taken the veil. The lady
appeared about nineteen or twenty years of age; she was not
handsome, but the occasion rendered her very interesting.</p>

<p>The first <small>RELIGIOUS PROCESSION</small> I had ever seen, was
that of St. Rosario, in Buenos Ayres; and it is not possible
I can forget the impression it made upon me. Those details
which, when a school-boy, I dwelt upon with such delight,
were now, in my manhood, brought full before my eyes,
losing nothing of their interest; on the contrary, I found that
imagination does not always come up to the reality. The
churches of France and Belgium I had visited with far
different emotions: Spain, and Spanish connexions, thought
I, contain all that can fix the attention of the Protestant
inquirer, who wishes to see the Catholic church the same
in the nineteenth as in the fourteenth century. Spain
clings to it; with its many imperfections, as a fond lover to
an idolized mistress; else they would not have suffered
foreigners to overrun their soil. What would the heroes
of Roncevalles and Pavia have said to those events?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">-&nbsp;112&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The figure of St. Rosario, full-robed, was carried by
soldiers, on a stage. The Virgin, on another stage, followed,
flanked by numbers of the faithful carrying large lighted
candles; these were chiefly old men, and boys. The host,
and attendant priests wafting incense towards this sacred
emblem, formed a conspicuous part; with groups of friars
chaunting their prayers, in which they are joined by the
crowd. A huge cross, apparently of silver, and borne by
friars, precedes the whole. A small band of violinists attend,
and accompany the singing: they reminded me of
our itinerant musicians, that serenade us of an evening in
London. The military band has a better effect. A halt
is made, at intervals, at the corners of streets, or opposite
temporary altars, which the devotion of the pious has
raised in front of their houses: they consist of tables,
covered with white linen, with small images of Jesus, the
Virgin, crosses, &amp;c. &amp;c. and a mirror, garnished with flowers
and other decorations. Soldiers march in front and rear.
They, as well as every one else near the procession, are
uncovered; and when the ceremonies of the host are going
on, all must kneel. The houses display silks, tapestry, and
other finery, arranged in front, in the streets through which
the cavalcade passes; and the balconies are filled with
spectators. The saints and his dumb attendants (the
images), are finally deposited at their head-quarters, the
church. A great quantity of females are always to be
seen at those exhibitions, fervently ejaculating their &ldquo;Ave-Marias.&rdquo;<!--added &rdquo;--></p>

<p>These processions vary but very little, except that I
thought there was more of preparation, banners, &amp;c. in
that of St. Nicholas, on the 6th December. The streets
were profusely adorned, road and foot-path strewed with
flowers, leaves, and boughs. Small cannon were placed on
the pavement near the church, the firing of which, and the
discharge of rockets and other fire-works, gave notice
that the saint and his holy attendants were about to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">-&nbsp;113&nbsp;-</a></span>
the church. Gentlemen, both civil and military, of the
first families, at times, bear banners in the procession.
These days being kept as holidays, a vast concourse stroll
about the decorated streets before the attraction of the
day begins. The windows, house-tops, and benches
ranged near the houses, are occupied by females, the lovely
persons of some of whom might move an anchorite. A
scene so new has almost upset my sober reasoning; and
I have looked at the host, friars, crosses, music, and all the
et ceteras, till I could nearly fancy that time had rolled back,
and found me living when the Catholic church knew no
rival.</p>

<p>The feast of St. Nicholas, in December, 1824, was but
a mockery of its former splendour: however, the church of
San Nicholas was illuminated, and looked very pretty; and
we had some bonfires, music, and fire-works. A procession
was to have taken place, but the government would not
pay the expense, and the church, in its present reduced
state, cannot afford it. The devotees muttered their Ave-Marias
and maledictions; but, as St. Nicholas did not interfere
in their behalf, all went off quietly.</p>

<p>The feast of Corpus Christi is another grand day. The
whole body of friars, with banners and flags of their different
orders, mustered on the occasion, and, before the suppression
of the monasteries, they constituted a decent battalion.
The dress of the friars differs in nothing to what
we find represented in England,&mdash;the cowl and crown,
with the small cross suspended. The processions, in the
course of the year, used to be very numerous. Since the
dispersion of the friars, they are somewhat shorn of their
beams; and, by-and-by, the sight of a friar may be a curiosity.
To decorate the churches on these occasions, the
priests borrow candlesticks, silks, &amp;c. of their neighbours.</p>

<p>During Lent, sermons are preached on an evening, in
various churches. The congregations are numerous, and
the females always kneel. The custom of allowing males<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">-&nbsp;114&nbsp;-</a></span>
to be seated in church, while the other sex are upon their
knees, appears strange.</p>

<p>As the theatre is situated opposite the Merced church,
during the sermons of the Lent evenings, some of the congregation
may be seen wandering from the church to the
theatre.</p>

<p>In passion week, there are various masses and sermons.</p>

<p>The afternoon and evening of Holy Thursday bring
forth all the world into the streets: every house appears
deserted. The concourse is astonishing: the great proportion
are females. A rule of Catholic creed enjoins them to
visit seven churches on this day; and this they religiously
perform, stopping but a few minutes in each church, just
time enough to kneel, and utter a short prayer. The
governor and his aides-de-camp, likewise, go to seven
churches. A crowd of both sexes assemble round the
doors, especially of the Cathedral, absolutely blocking up
the road way, kneeling, counting beads, and in earnest
prayer.</p>

<p>In 1821, I saw images and other insignia of the church at
the corners of the principal streets; prisoners ironed, with
their guards, soliciting charity; small tables, with virgins,
Jesus, and crosses: but these customs have much fallen off.
Near a church, those altars are still raised on Holy Thursday,
and people press around, to kiss the garments of the
&ldquo;mother of God.&rdquo; Near St. Juan&rsquo;s church, in 1824, I observed
a pretty design of this nature upon a small scale,
and envied the kisses it received from some charming girls.
On this night, too, the military bands muster in their best
dresses, with drums muffled, and other marks of mourning.
They advance across the Plaza, and through the streets,
at a solemn pace, playing music even more melancholy than
the Dead March in Saul, preceded by one of the soldiers
carrying, on a pole, a balloon with transparencies, and a
light inside, which makes them look a counterpart of those
that paraded London streets, a few years ago, from the lottery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">-&nbsp;115&nbsp;-</a></span>
offices. During this period of mourning, both sexes are
clothed in black. This continual crowd in the streets, and
the peculiar church attire, serve to attract one&rsquo;s attention;
it is so much the reverse of our English mode: we go to
church in all the colours of the rainbow.</p>

<p>In addition to other observances of Holy Thursday the
flags of vessels belonging to Catholic nations are half-masted,
yards crossed, and at the Fort, likewise, they remain till near
twelve o&rsquo;clock on the Saturday, at which hour cannon are
fired, yards squared, the flag run up, bells rung, and shops
are opened, for the joyful resurrection. But the bells do
not give us those inspiring peals that we hear from our
churches of St. Martin&rsquo;s, St. Clement&rsquo;s, and from the far-famed
Bow bells: here, they are an inharmonious jangle.
Our churches, so superb in architectural splendour, would
astonish those gentlemen who fancy an Englishman&rsquo;s taste
only leads him towards vending merchandize, and receiving
the proceeds.</p>

<p>Good Friday passes as a solemn day of prayer and
mourning.</p>

<p>The burning of Judas is a grotesque affair. Stuffed
figures, like our old Guys, are suspended from ropes in the
middle of the street, charged with combustibles and fire-works.
On the night of Saturday, they are fired, and Mr.
Judas is blown up, amidst the shouts of the multitude.
This, like our Guy Fawkes, has much fallen off, and may
soon drop altogether. The newspapers have designated
it barbarism. I am not for meddling with the sports of the
lower orders, if they do not offend decency. The quarrel
with Captain O&rsquo;Brien happened about Easter, 1821; and
one of the Judases of that period was observed in something
of the dress of a naval officer: report said, it was
meant for Captain O&rsquo;Brien. It was ordered to be taken
down. The people took very little interest in that dispute.
When it was at its height, the Captain passed through a
crowd opposite the College church, and they treated him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">-&nbsp;116&nbsp;-</a></span>
with great respect, making way for the &ldquo;English Commandant&rdquo;
to pass. &ldquo;We may all suffer in this business,&rdquo;
said our captain to one of his countrymen; &ldquo;but we shall,
if extremes are resorted to, be gloriously revenged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The holy or passion week in 1825 passed off much as
usual. On the Thursday evening the ladies crowded the
churches and streets in their black attire; and being a fine
moonlight night, the scene (to me at least) was very interesting;
and although I did not follow the custom of
visiting seven churches on this evening, I went to four.
At the Cathedral I remained a considerable time, listening
to the music of the vespers. The fine bass voice of Friar
Juan was sadly missed. He was banished for being concerned
in the conspiracy of the 19th March, 1823. Valentin
Gomez, one of the canons of the church, sat in full
pontifical robes. Some of the Spaniards were jesting, in
the church, upon his portly appearance, so different from
the figure he cut at nearly the same period last year, when
shipwrecked upon the English bank in the river Plate. I
felt much impressed with my visit to the Cathedral: every
thing combined to make me so;&mdash;the music, lights, and
glittering altars, with the prostrate females attended by their
slaves and servants.</p>

<p>The sermons at the churches, on the evenings of Lent,
were well attended. The friar who preached at the
church of Le Merced always attracted great crowds. At
the porch of this church was placed an image of Christ,
as large as life, in the act of being scourged; many
devout females kissed the ropes which tied the wrists of
the image.</p>

<p>Till late in the evening of Holy Thursday, people were
kneeling before the church doors, counting beads, and saying
their Ave-Marias. At nine o&rsquo;clock at night, three military
bands of music, of the artillery, Ca&ccedil;adores, and Legion de la
Patria, each preceded by the globe, or balloon, with transparencies,
carried upon a pole, entered the Plaza with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">-&nbsp;117&nbsp;-</a></span>
drums muffled, and playing solemn airs. The artillery
band was much admired; Masoni, and other professors,
performed in it. I followed two of the bands to their barracks,
at the Retiro. The night was lovely; and it was
late ere I returned home, my thoughts entirely absorbed
in the scenes of the day.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of Good Friday, the mass at the cathedral
was well attended.</p>

<p>The custom of burning Judas has fallen off. On the
Saturday, this year, the rain fell in torrents; but, a few
nights after, Judas was burnt near the Victoria coffee-house,
amidst fire-works and music.</p>

<p>Another great object of attention to us Protestants is
the Holy Ghost proceeding through the streets, to administer
the last offices of religion to those who are presumed
to be in a dying state. The holy father, and one attendant,
both richly attired, are seated in a coach drawn by
white mules. They go at a walking pace, with a few
soldiers for escort; negresses, boys, and others, carrying
lighted lanterns, both by night and day. A bell warns
passengers of its approach, when all within view must be
uncovered, and, when they are near the carriage, kneel.
This last operation, not being very agreeable in dirty weather,
foreigners try to avoid his holiness altogether, by
going up other streets. Equestrians descend from their
horses, and kneel. At night, lights are placed in the windows
of the houses they pass, and their inmates kneel.
Why do you kneel? said I, to a slave boy, at a house in
which I resided. &ldquo;Because God is in the coach,&rdquo; he replied.
A brutal soldier, of the escort, once knocked an
Englishman down, for not kneeling in time. The magistrates
took cognizance of it; and, I hear, that strangers are
not now obliged to kneel, though common respect will always
teach them to be uncovered. In passing the guardhouses,
the guards turn out, drums are beat, &amp;c. They
have now a large bell, the small one having been mistaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">-&nbsp;118&nbsp;-</a></span>
for those belonging to the water carts:<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> a Londoner might
mistake it for the bell of the six-o&rsquo;clock-afternoon postman.</p>

<p>Great veneration is paid to all that concerns this ceremony
of the Holy Ghost: the very mules, it is said, were
formerly looked upon as sacred. In passing coffee-houses,
billiard-players, and gamblers of all descriptions, leave their
profane games, to kneel. At the theatre, the performance
is stopped; actors and actresses kneel on the stage, and the
audience upon their seats. I have several times been present
at scenes of this sort, and regarded them with great curiosity;
though I have been very angry with the holy father,
and impious enough to wish he had taken another route.
I recollect, during an opera, one evening, the cavalcade
passed no less than three times, and interrupted a delightful
duet between Rosquellas and Se&ntilde;ora Tani.</p>

<p>The summer of 1824-5, judging from the frequent appearance
of the Holy Ghost in the streets, must have been
rather a sickly one. Great respect is still paid to this holy
visitant, who generally selects the evening to pay his visits.
A smile will now and then take place, when the procession
suddenly appears in a crowded neighbourhood, forcing all
to bend the knee. The contrast of such Catholic customs
with those of our sober England often occurs to me.</p>

<p>I am informed that great preparations take place in the
sick chamber, where the sacrament is to be given. I do
not admire this. The patient, enfeebled by disease, concludes
there is no hope left; and often yields to despair.
In England, on such occasions, a clergyman comes without
pomp or attendants: his attentions are more like those of
a friend, and he insensibly prepares the mind of the sufferer
for the purposes of his visit. But we have much to correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">-&nbsp;119&nbsp;-</a></span>
in the dismal funeral bell, closing shops and windows, usual
with us at burials. Life hourly presents enough to remind
us of death, without those auxiliaries.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Funeral Ceremonies</span>.&mdash;The room in which a corpse
is deposited is lighted; large candles are placed round the
coffin; and the wainscoting, tables, &amp;c. are covered with
white furniture, crosses, &amp;c. The windows are often
thrown open, for passengers to view the scene of death, as
a warning that &ldquo;to this complexion we must come at last.&rdquo;
I remember my surprise on first seeing a spectacle of this
sort. The corpse of a female about thirty lay shrouded in
her coffin, the lid of which was taken off, with her hands
folded over her breast, and a small cross placed between
them. The gaudy coffin, and the lights around it, gave it
the appearance of wax work; indeed, I had an impression
that it was so, for some minutes, not being aware of the
country&rsquo;s fashion in this affair.</p>

<p>Deceased persons are interred twenty-four hours after
their decease; a necessary precaution in a warm climate.
From the crowded state of the church-yards, they are now
taken to the New Burial-Ground, at the Recolator; and
corpses were removed thither from the church-yards, after
having been buried some time. Scenes of confusion, in
consequence, took place; with various imprecations from
near relations, as mothers, husbands, and wives, upon recognizing
the bodies of those whom they never expected
to have seen again in this world.</p>

<p>The hearses are modelled after the French fashion, and
are not followed by mourners. The relatives of the deceased
attend the burial-ground to receive the body, and the
church ceremonies of mass, &amp;c. take place some days after.</p>

<p>The death of a friar, or any priest, is announced by a
particular tolling of the bell.</p>

<p>The masses for the repose of the soul are performed at
various churches, according to the wish of the relatives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">-&nbsp;120&nbsp;-</a></span>
who issue printed notices, inviting the friends of the deceased.
Any one is at liberty to attend. Those of respectability,
who can afford to pay, have several masses:
but it is rather an expensive affair. The ceremony lasts
from one to two hours. An imitation coffin is placed near
the altar, surrounded by lights. If it be for a military or
public man, the sword and hat are placed on the coffin, and
a company of soldiers fire a volley at the church door.
Towards the end of the mass, candles are put into the hands
of the male part of the congregation, and in a few minutes
taken from them again, and extinguished. At the close,
the priests and friars, headed by their superior, take their
station, in two lines, near the door, and receive and
return the obeisances of the congregation. The relations
and particular friends adjourn to the dwelling-house (sometimes
to the refectory of the church), where a repast is prepared,
of cakes, fruit, wine, liqueurs, beer, &amp;c. the room
being lighted, and hung with black and white decorations.
I have heard some charming music in these masses, and it
is far from being an unimpressive scene: the holding a
light at the requiem of those we loved, carries with it a
pleasing idea. There is, however, more real feeling in the
simple country church-yard funerals in England, than in
all this appeal to the senses.</p>

<p>A fantastic ornamented hearse, for carrying the bodies
of children to their last home, has lately come into use.
It has plumes of white feathers streaming from the top,
and is drawn by two mules; the rider, a boy, is clothed
after the manner of Astley&rsquo;s equestrians.</p>

<p>Until the year 1821, the Protestants had no allotted
place of burial; and, to satisfy the jealousy of the church,
various subterfuges were obliged to be resorted to, in order
to obtain something like a christian funeral. The government
gave permission, and a piece of ground was bought,
near the Retiro, for a cemetery, which has been inclosed,
and a small chapel, with a neat portico of the Doric order,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">-&nbsp;121&nbsp;-</a></span>
erected. The expence amounted to 4800 dollars, which
was defrayed by Protestants of all classes: the British,
were, of course, the chief contributors. The number buried
there, from January 1821, to June 1824, was 71; of which
60 were British subjects. The service is read by some
of the parties present.</p>

<p>At the funerals in the Protestant Burial-Ground, I have
seen many Buenos Ayreans, both male and female, attracted
thither by curiosity; they paid great attention, and expressed
their approbation of our method of making the
graves so deep.</p>

<p>Before this ground was opened, Protestants were buried
without any service being read, and the shallow ground
was hastily filled up. It was a favour that their fellowman
was allowed to take up his &ldquo;everlasting rest&rdquo; in holy
Catholic earth. I saw an English sailor interred in the
Cathedral church-yard: a police-man attended, to see that
no unfair means had been used, and three or four friars
were strolling about. The sailor mourners eyed them
askance, declaring it was shameful that they did not offer to
perform the funeral service: &ldquo;But what can you expect,&rdquo;
they added, &ldquo;in such an unchristianlike land?&rdquo; Their
resentment was increased by seeing the mutilated body of
a dead black child, which, from the nature of their graves,
had made its appearance above the surface.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Police</span>, &amp;c.&mdash;To every barrier or parish an <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">alcalde</i>, or
sitting magistrate, is appointed, who takes cognizance of
the offences and disputes in his jurisdiction, and superintends
the night-patrole. Every male is liable to be called
out to act as watchman for the night; and he must attend, or
provide a substitute, which costs six reals; and as this
happens very often, strangers find it a tax. The patrole
are armed with musquets and bayonets, and proceed
through the streets at intervals during the night, visiting
public houses, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">-&nbsp;122&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The most inferior officer connected with the police, or
any public office, carries a rusty dragoon sword with him
as his staff of office. The very messenger that delivers
the summons for the nightly patrole comes thus armed,
and upon the least provocation out goes the sword: this
has been of late years a little corrected.</p>

<p>Buenos Ayres can boast of a well-disposed and orderly
population. Robberies are sometimes committed, but nothing
to the extent that might be supposed; many more
are committed in an English city of the same magnitude,
notwithstanding the expensive police. I have been out
at all hours of the night, and have felt myself as secure
as though I were in London, and perhaps more so.</p>

<p>The only time that I ever met with any thing like annoyance
or interruption in the streets, was from a soldier on
guard at the Cabildo, who made an attempt to push me
from the pavement. I did not wish to notice the affair;
but a Creole friend insisted that I should do so, stating,
that in London he presumed Englishmen protected
strangers when insulted. He went with me to the guard-house,
alleged a complaint before an officer, and the
soldier was confined: he appeared to be drunk.</p>

<p>The great blot of this country is, that amongst the lower
orders, upon the least quarrel, knives are out; and what
in England would vent itself in black eyes and bloody noses,
here ends in murder; and until certain and speedy punishment
follows these deeds, it will ever be so. The crime
has decreased since the administration of Mr. Rivadavia,
and the enactment of the law prohibiting the wearing
of knives; still it continues in a degree. Justice is tardy,
and the chance that the criminal may again be at liberty
deters people from prosecuting, dreading his future vengeance.
In England, where the law is strong, every one
assists to apprehend an offender; but here a lukewarmness
exists.</p>

<p>Several have, within these three years, suffered death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">-&nbsp;123&nbsp;-</a></span>
for murder. I am inclined to think, that a law upon the plan
of Lord Ellenborough&rsquo;s act would do much to stop it.
A Portuguese, some months since, stabbed to death the
servant of Mr. Bevans, the Quaker engineer, in open day.
The opponents of boxing, in England, should pause ere
they so decidedly condemn it; its suppression might lead
to more fatal results in deciding quarrels.</p>

<p>It was a common event, long after I arrived, to see bodies
of persons who had been stabbed in some broil, exposed in
the Plaza, to be recognized by their relatives or friends,
with a saucer placed at their side to collect money to pay
the expences of burying them.</p>

<p>These murders are confined to the very lowest orders
of the people, and are generally the effect of a drunken
quarrel. I must do them the justice to say, that I have
not heard of any deliberate assassination, committed
either upon a native or foreigner. Their annals are free
from the refined murders of polished Europe, even, I regret
to add, of our own England; we must not always cite the
latter as an example, when we censure the abuses of other
countries.</p>

<p>This stabbing system was thought so little of in Buenos
Ayres, that no one cared to seize the murderer. If by
chance he was apprehended, a short imprisonment sufficed,
and he was then set at liberty to commit more crimes. Six
or seven murders have been related to me, as known to
have been committed by one man with apparent impunity;
and that these things should be so, excites the astonishment
of all strangers.</p>

<p>Foreigners newly arrived were accustomed to carry
pistols about their persons at night; but this is very seldom
the case now&mdash;they have more confidence.</p>

<p>The thieves, in some of their feats, may rank in ingenuity
with the second-rate ones with us. One of their operations
is hooking out clothes, linen, &amp;c. from rooms, by means of
a long pole with a hook at the end; and if the windows are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">-&nbsp;124&nbsp;-</a></span>
not fastened at night, a risk is run of being robbed, though
the iron bars should prevent any one from entering. Some
friends of mine, lodging at the American Hotel, were plundered
by those pole gentlemen one night, although sleeping
three in a room, and they knew not of their loss until the
morning, when they missed coats, trowsers, &amp;c.; a writing-desk
had also been hauled towards the window, the valuables
taken out, and the loose papers scattered about the street
and room. The comparing notes in the morning of their
losses, and cursing the marauders, was laughable enough.
Another friend was awoke at break of day, and observed
his waistcoat dangling in the middle of the room from the
top of a pole, and a man&rsquo;s arm extended through the iron
bars of the window guiding it. My friend having a
sword could with ease have cut off the thief&rsquo;s arm, but his
humanity prompted him rather to make an alarm; upon
which the pole and waistcoat were dropped, and the vagabond
made his escape. Very serious losses of papers have
been sustained by this mode of robbery.</p>

<p>The boys about the theatre door begging for the return
tickets, or &ldquo;contre-signs,&rdquo; were a great annoyance; they
were perfect thieves, and very impudent. I have lost
several pocket handkerchiefs by their talents. Having
refused to give my pass-check one night, they secretly followed
me, and when near the wall of the Merced church,
to my great surprise, saluted me with a shower of stones
and bricks: I pursued the young rascals, but it was without
effect. The soldiers prevent occurrences of this sort now,
and two or three that were caught in the fact have been
punished.</p>

<p>The boys in the streets of Buenos Ayres are as saucy a
set of ragamuffins as those of London, without that daring
and instant battle of the English boys. Many of their
juvenile sports are similar to our&rsquo;s; as kite flying, pitch in
the hole, &amp;c. They have a system of managing their kites,
which may be called privateering: a knife is affixed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">-&nbsp;125&nbsp;-</a></span>
tail of the kite, with which they endeavour to entangle
other kites, and cut the string; should they succeed, knife,
kite, string&mdash;all become lawful prize. Cricket, trap-ball,
hoops, tops, and skipping, they do not practise. Riding
on the backs of sheep, harnessed as horses, is another
amusement; and those mutton cavalry are very expert.</p>

<p>The boys of the upper class are exceedingly well-behaved,
and have very pleasing manners: they excel our&rsquo;s
in this respect. The greatest care is bestowed upon them;
and we do not meet with that roughness among them,
which is observable in my young countryfolks. The Buenos
Ayres boy addresses a stranger in the street hat in
hand, and with the greatest respect.</p>

<p>Since my abode in Buenos Ayres, I have been lucky
enough to keep clear of all law proceedings; and never,
until lately, visited a judicial court, except from curiosity.
I was, however, requested to appear, in order to speak to
the character of an English sailor, who was imprisoned at the
Cabildo for a row, on the beach. I visited the prison, and
found poor Jack roaming about a spacious yard, with lots
of other prisoners; he spoke highly of the kind treatment
he had received in prison. The presiding judge, or magistrate
(a most gentlemanly man), after hearing the depositions
read, discharged the sailor, no witnesses appearing
for the prosecution. Mr. Poussett, the vice-consul,
attended upon this occasion, and received every attention
from the judge.</p>

<p>The mode of punishment by death is shooting; many
think that hanging would be more appropriate for murder,
and that the soldier&rsquo;s death ought to be reserved for a
soldier: however, death cancels all crimes.</p>

<p>In a public whipping, the offender is placed on a horse
or mule, with his back bared, and his hands tied, and at
the corners of streets he receives his punishment: those
disgusting scenes I always avoid, if I can. I came once in
contact with one: the poor wretch did not seem to suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">-&nbsp;126&nbsp;-</a></span>
much; I fancied I had been as severely flogged at school.
They appeared to strike him about a dozen quick blows
at a time, with a piece of wood like a scrubbing-brush
with some sharp substance attached.</p>

<p>Those ordered for imprisonment, are made to work in
the streets, heavily ironed.</p>

<p>Sailors are punished by being put in the stocks; and
for criminal offences, they are made to work in the streets
in irons.</p>

<p>The close of the year 1824 witnessed a great increase
of crime in Buenos Ayres. An atrocious murder was committed
by two black fellows, upon a Genoese, who kept a
tin shop near the College church. The murderers were
apprehended, and shot at the Retiro, and their bodies afterwards
suspended upon a gallows. A boy, accessary to the
fact (having let the villains into the house), escaped capital
punishment, being under the age regulated by law: he was,
however, present at the execution. Two fellows broke into
the house of Mr. Nelson, an English merchant, and stabbed
his man-servant in several places; an alarm being given,
they effected their escape. The servant recovered from
his wounds. Numerous other robberies have taken place;
amongst which, Mr. Parvin, an American clergyman, and
three of his friends, were stripped of their clothes, a short
distance from town.</p>

<p>The first execution in this country for forgery took
place in February, 1825, upon the person of Marcelo Valdivia,
who was shot at the Retiro. By the old Spanish
law, a person convicted of forgery was condemned to lose
his hand. This young man had been before sentenced to
death for the same crime, but his punishment was commuted
to exposure in the Plaza, imprisonment for eight
years, and banishment for life. In July, 1824, he underwent
the first part of his sentence, being seated in the Plaza
for four hours, with the notes he had forged suspended
from his breast. In prison, he committed other forgeries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">-&nbsp;127&nbsp;-</a></span>
including a forged order for his own release. The government
have been highly applauded for their firmness in
punishing this criminal. His friends applied to the British
consul for his intercession, which was declined. Colonel
Forbes, the American agent, was much censured for having,
in 1821, interfered and saved a murderer from justice.</p>

<p>A black woman was shot, for attempting the life of her
mistress. The execution of a female is a rare thing in this
country.</p>

<p>Much as Buenos Ayres has improved in her jurisprudence,
she has still a great deal to amend&mdash;that part which
relates to committal before trial for civil offences particularly.
The two following circumstances passed under my
observation.</p>

<p>Upon the first issue of paper money, some forgeries
were detected. An English captain, West, of the brig
<i>Fortune</i>, conversing on this subject at a tavern, remarked,
that a forgery might easily be effected; and that the gentlemen
in that line at home would not be long about such a
thing. This was reported to the police; and he was sent to
prison without examination, upon suspicion of knowing of
the forged notes, and was not released for some days.</p>

<p>In another case, Captain Harrison, of the brig <i>Asia</i>,
was imprisoned nearly a month, for bringing a false report
of Monte Video being blockaded; which was indeed partly
true, Brazilian schooners of war having been off there,
and sailed for Colonia.</p>

<p>If such regulations were followed in England, we must
build more prisons as well as churches, and I know not
what would become of the gentlemen of the Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>The trial by jury, which alone is worth fighting for, may
yet reach South America. Every abuse cannot at once be
rectified; they have, already, done wonders in this country.</p>

<p>Law proceedings are as expensive and tardy here, as in
other parts of the globe. What with depositions, answers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">-&nbsp;128&nbsp;-</a></span>
&amp;c. the suit goes on for years to the great benefit of lawyers;
but they have reformed a great deal of the old obnoxious
Spanish laws, particularly as they related to foreigners and
their property. By the old law, when a foreigner died,
their property in the country went to the state.</p>

<p>To leave Buenos Ayres, if it is only for a neighbouring
town, passports must be obtained, which cost two dollars
to quit the country, and four reals for any neighbouring
town. Surprise is expressed that we can manage without
those ceremonies in England; some passengers arriving
from thence were once asked by a visiting officer for their
English passports.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Army</span>.&mdash;The standing army of the province consists of
from 2500 to 3000 men in six regiments, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i> three of
infantry, and three of cavalry. Of the infantry, there is
one regiment of artillery, one Ca&ccedil;adores, and one of the line.
There are also two regiments of Civicas, or militia.</p>

<p>The troops have lately improved, both in appearance
and discipline; and indeed, there was great need of it:
at present, a great deal cannot be said in their praise.
Their man&oelig;uvres are few, such as forming line, companies,
&amp;c. and some minor movements, as firing volleys, street firing,
&amp;c. sufficient, probably, for the warfare in which they are
likely to be engaged. The sudden change of front, close
column, solid squares, the quick deploying into line, close
firing, and rapid bayonet charge, are not to be seen among
the troops of Buenos Ayres. Against veterans they could
make but a feeble resistance; but in defending the town,
with the assistance of the inhabitants and their house fortifications,
they would be invincible; and to this mode of
fighting I would advise the Buenos Ayreans to trust,
should their city ever again be attacked.</p>

<p>The artillery corps are better: they work the guns with
smartness, and have a good train of artillery, of six, eight,
and twelve pounders, taken from the Spaniards at Monte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">-&nbsp;129&nbsp;-</a></span>
Video and other places. Repeated exercise and firing
take place with those great guns, early in a morning, on
the beach.</p>

<p>The uniform coat of the soldiers is blue, with different
facings of red, white, and green: they have caps like our
infantry. The undress is a foraging cap, with a loop
hanging on one side, trowsers of all colours, and some
without shoes or stockings. The recruits are not immediately
clothed in the soldier&rsquo;s uniform, but drilled in
all their dirt and native raggedness. The population will
not admit of the mode of recruiting practised in Europe;
they take every one they can: the equipments and material
of their army are not, in consequence, very imposing.</p>

<p>If the men, in their attire, look sometimes like Sir John
Falstaff&rsquo;s famed regiment&mdash;not so the officers; they have
fine showy uniforms, and cocked hats with the national
cockade. The subaltern part are young men; the colonels
make a good soldier-like appearance. Colonel Ramirez,
in his blue coat and gold epaulets, always puts me in mind
of a British naval officer; and Colonel Alvarez, who was
wounded in our storming of Monte Video, reminds me of
Raymond of Drury-Lane theatre.</p>

<p>There are some French and German officers in the
service: the former, in blue coats and white facings, still
look like the soldiers of Napoleon.</p>

<p>The only English officer at present in the military service
of Buenos Ayres, is a gentleman named Charles Bowness;
who, from having been nearly fifteen years in this country,
is, in appearance, more like a Spaniard than an Englishman.
He left England when very young, and has not
heard of his family since his departure.</p>

<p>It was seldom that military officers were seen out of
uniform; they wore it in the theatre, in the coffee-house,
and in the assembly. But this fashion has changed; and
when not on duty, the dress of the citizen is now preferred.
On the continent of Europe, we are in constant contact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">-&nbsp;130&nbsp;-</a></span>
with the military, and as constantly reminded of military
despotism.</p>

<p>The infantry soldier is armed with a musquet and
bayonet: the musquets have the Tower of London mark,
and, as well as the cavalry swords, would look all the
better for cleaning. The sergeants of infantry do not
carry halberts. The regular cavalry are few in number,
and not quite so brilliant as the Marquis of Anglesea&rsquo;s
crack regiment, or the Tenth Hussars.</p>

<p>The punishment of flogging is resorted to: I have often
heard the cries of the sufferers belonging to a black
regiment, quartered near my abode. I fear it is impossible
to keep discipline without it, or public opinion would, long
ere this, have suppressed it in England.</p>

<p>The bands of music attached to the regiments have made
great progress in their profession: three years ago they
were hardly bearable. Unfortunately, now, the ruling
military authorities will not give us much opportunity of
judging of their talents. They were accustomed, on a fine
evening, to leave the Fort, in the summer at nine, in the
winter at eight o&rsquo;clock, and crossing the Plaza, take their
station in one of the streets adjoining, generally the street
of Victoria, or, as we named it, Bond Street, from its
being the fashionable one, and filled with shops: here they
would entertain us for an hour or more, and I have been
gratified in hearing many tunes that charmed me in
Europe, such as the overture to <cite>Lodoiska</cite>, &amp;c. Another
attraction was the number of girls that nightly attended:
many a lover (&ldquo;how silvery sweet sound lovers&rsquo; tongues by
night&rdquo;) has taken this opportunity to address his fair one.
On a moonlight night, I have frequently viewed the countenances
and elegant figures of the sweet creatures, no
envious bonnet intercepting; and now some unmusical
being has deprived me of this pleasure&mdash;I wish he would
read Lorenzo&rsquo;s observation in the <cite>Merchant of Venice</cite> upon
those who lack taste in <a id="music">music</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">-&nbsp;131&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>About four times in the week, however, at eight or
nine in the evening, one of the military bands parade from
the Fort to their barracks at the Retiro, and at times we
have heard some good music. On a fine night much
company attend. From constant practice, the regimental
musical bands have become proficients in their art; they
perform some fine pieces of music, including the overture
to <cite>Lodoiska</cite>, and the <cite>Polacca</cite> from the opera of <cite>The
Cabinet</cite>. Braham ever occurs to my memory, when I
hear the latter performed, and the enthusiasm with which
a London audience always hail this song.</p>

<p>The dresses of the bands are of the Turkish costume,
and though not so splendid as our third regiment of foot-guards,
are equal to those of the line. They have instruments
of English manufacture, all that constitutes a military
band&mdash;triangle, cymbals, and bells, similar to our first
regiment of Guards.</p>

<p>In 1820, some English shopkeepers and mechanics, in
the excess of their zeal, determined to form a corps of
cavalry, to act as body-guard to the governor. Twenty or
thirty equipped themselves in a light blue jacket, and nondescript
cap, and attended the procession as the life-guards
of the state. The St. George assault, and vulgar exercise
of the sword, made no part of their discipline. Now,
whether Englishmen make but a poor figure when armed
in the service of a foreign people, or that opinion is against
it, from Coriolanus downwards, I know not; certain it is,
that this regiment has decreased from its full complement
to some five or six rank and file.</p>

<p>It was the custom until lately, to fire the fort guns on
every 4th of July, the anniversary of our expedition under
Whitelock. If they have discontinued it to spare us the
mortification of being reminded of such an event, from my
very soul I thank them;&mdash;it is a subject that makes the
heart ache to think upon. No one can view the houses
of Buenos Ayres without being struck with the impossibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">-&nbsp;132&nbsp;-</a></span>
of taking a town by such a mode of attack as it was our fate
to pursue, against an inflamed population who were, from
the highest to the lowest, our enemies. Well-informed men
know that 5 or 6000 troops, with an adequate artillery,
might have taken the town without scarcely entering it, and,
what is more, by proper precautions might have kept it.
The Spaniards had no troops of any consequence to
oppose us; and if all the population of the town had ventured
out of their fastnesses to combat us, the issue would
not have been for one moment doubtful; for, as the lamented
General Ross observed, when inquiring of an American
friend of mine, his prisoner, the force near Baltimore, &ldquo;I
ask you, sir, of the regulars; it may rain militia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our wounded, they tell me, were treated with kindness,
especially by the female part of the population, who had
been amongst the most inveterate of our foes. The heretic
Englishman is not looked upon with that horror now, as
it was formerly the fashion to paint him.</p>

<p>In the Annual Almanack, the following paragraph is
tacked to the fatal 4th of July:&mdash;&ldquo;Service in St. Domingo
church: thanks to our Se&ntilde;ora and St. Rosario, for the
triumph, under their protection, in the year 1807, in having
vanquished 12,000 English who attacked us.&rdquo; With Macbeth,
I am ready to exclaim, &ldquo;May that pernicious hour
stand aye accursed in the calendar!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That such unlooked-for success should have inflated
their imaginations is to be expected; but, in justice to this
kind people, I must mention, that in English company they
never in any way allude to the affair. They are well aware
of the disadvantages we had to encounter, and that our
troops were exposed to an absolute massacre.</p>

<p>I could fill pages with the anecdotes that have been told
me of Beresford, Pack, and other officers; but it is a
theme I care not to dwell upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Government, and Public Events</span>.&mdash;The government
of Buenos Ayres is an attempt at republicanism, without its
simplicity. However, if the people are contented, we must
not quarrel about forms, or expect an Utopia. I am no
particular friend to republics; I have seen and enjoyed so
much real liberty and happiness under the limited monarchy
of my own country, that I can fancy no other form of
government better.</p>

<p>The present governor, Don Gregorio Heras, is a military
man: he served in several campaigns against the Spaniards,
and is reported to be a man of decided character. In his
opening speech to the junta, he observed, that, &ldquo;being determined
to obey the laws himself, he expected every one
else to do the same.&rdquo; Se&ntilde;or Heras is tall and personable,
about forty-five years of age, with rather an expressive
countenance. His title is Governor and Captain-General
of the Province of Buenos Ayres. His prerogatives are
very limited.</p>

<p>The governor, when taking the air in his carriage, has
an escort of two dragoons; when on horseback, he is generally
accompanied by his aides-de-camp.</p>

<p>Every public officer is allowed a soldier, who acts both
as guard and servant, and is called the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ordenanza</i>. The
French Engineer cuts a great figure, with his soldier riding
behind him: our humble Quaker prefers walking.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">-&nbsp;134&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Se&ntilde;or Garcia fills the office of secretary of state, having
succeeded Mr. Rivadavia.</p>

<p>The Junta, or senate, consists of forty-eight members,
who are elected annually: Se&ntilde;or Don Manuel Pinto is
the president. The last election brought in several of
the radical party; one or two of whom are the Humes of
the Buenos-Ayres House of Commons. Since the secession
of Mr. Rivadavia, Se&ntilde;or Gomez leads the ministerial
side.</p>

<p>Se&ntilde;or Dorrego, who now distinguishes himself as an opposition
speaker, is a colonel. In 1820, when the town
was threatened by some armed countrymen, called Monteneros,
he, on the spur of the moment, collected porters
and carmen, and drove the enemy away, proving himself a
dashing soldier. For a short period he assumed the
&ldquo;imperial purple,&rdquo; until Rodriguez and his Colorados, in
October, 1820, displaced him.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day on which the election for
the members of the Junta terminates, a military band,
with the balloon, or globe, preceding it, and attended
by a crowd of young men, parades through the streets.
The band stops opposite the houses of the members,
and performs an air or two; the mob&mdash;if there is such
a thing as a mob in Buenos Ayres&mdash;all the time shouting,
&ldquo;Viva la Patria!&rdquo; &ldquo;The representatives of the people for
ever!&rdquo; &amp;c. If the Buenos Ayreans were to see our last day
of an election&mdash;the thousands of mobility and patriots,
hoarse with bawling&mdash;the banners&mdash;the rough music of
marrow-bones and cleavers, tuned from counter-tenor to
double bass&mdash;the sight, I think, would astonish, if not
frighten them.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">-&nbsp;135&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The 25th of May, 1810, is the &aelig;ra of the independence
of Buenos Ayres; the period when, the French armies
having overrun Spain, the people of this city deposed the
viceroy, and appointed a junta of nine as a provisional
government. This event is annually commemorated by a
festival of three days. It commences on the evening of the
24th, when the Plaza is illuminated, by means of a lofty
circle, formed of wood-work, erected round it. At sunrise
on the 25th, the national hymn is sung by boys, &amp;c.
opposite the pyramid in the Plaza: to hail the rising sun
is a Peruvian custom. In the day-time, various sports
take place: greased masts are erected, at the summit of
which are shawls, watches, and purses of money; and whoever
can reach the top, may take any one of the above
prizes. An English sailor, in 1822, brought down all the
stock in trade, wrapping the shawls about his body, and
putting the watches, money, and other articles, in his
pockets and mouth. On his descent, he was surrounded
by soldiers, who took away his booty; and on Jack making
a shew of resistance, they marched him to prison. The
bystanders, however, were indignant at this, and he was
soon released, and allowed to retain one of the prizes.
These masts cause great diversion, as very few succeed in
mounting them; and our sailor was highly applauded.
There is also an ingenious machine, called <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rompe cabeza</i>,
or break head, consisting of a pole placed lengthwise on
pivots, elevated from the ground, with a cord on which to
rest the feet. The difficulty is in getting along this pole;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">-&nbsp;136&nbsp;-</a></span>
in doing which, hundreds are thrown off: the successful
candidate obtains a piece of money. Military music plays
at night in the galleries of the Cabildo; and fire-balloons
and fire-works are let off, the latter emitting their balls of
fire among the people. From the careless manner in
which the fire-works are used by boys in the streets, I
am surprised that no accidents happen.</p>

<p>The theatre is open every night of the holidays, and is
always crowded; the anthem is sung; and they have extra
lights, &amp;c. The governor and his suite attend.</p>

<p>In the College church, on the 25th of May, prizes are
distributed to those young females who have excelled in
any particular branch of their studies. The ladies of the
town take great interest in this, and attend the church in
crowds. The organ performs during the ceremony, as
well as other music.</p>

<p>In 1821, the rejoicings went off gloomily, with little or
no preparations.</p>

<p>The arrangements in May, 1822, were the best that I
have seen. The weather&mdash;indeed, every thing combined
in its favour. Children of both sexes, dressed in fanciful
costume, danced upon a stage in the Plaza, and at the
theatre, and were drawn through the streets upon ornamental
cars, by persons disguised as lions, tigers, and
leopards. The music of the Plaza dance even now dwells
upon my mind, producing remembrances I can scarcely
account for. Its soft and pretty music ought to make it a
standard dance for the 25th May. In this May, of 1822,
I was delighted, and, for the moment, relieved from worldly
cares. I strayed, at evening, about the Plaza: the mimic
angels I could almost fancy real; and the sweet dark-eyed
girls that every moment met my eye were, to me, Houris
of Mahomet&rsquo;s Paradise. The illusion was complete: but,
alas! like all other earthly pleasures, it has passed away&mdash;would
that I could add, as a &ldquo;dream slightly remembered.&rdquo;
A troop of equestrians rode through the streets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">-&nbsp;137&nbsp;-</a></span>
dressed like Astley&rsquo;s horsemen, and masqued: they proceeded
to the Alameda, and fixing a small ring to a cord
in the middle, they each endeavoured to pull it down at full
gallop.</p>

<p>In 1823, the weather was cold and wet. The Quaker
made an effort to light the Police-Office with gas; it only
partially succeeded: the words <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Viva la Patria</i> blazed out
at intervals. Considering the obstacles, I am astonished he
did so much.</p>

<p>In 1824, the weather was fine; but, to me, the affair appeared
altogether inferior to 1822. There was no dancing,
or Astley&rsquo;s troop; the fire-works were something better,
and were judiciously placed on the arch, instead of the
Cathedral, as heretofore.</p>

<p>On the 25th of May, the governor and the public officers,
with the dignitaries of the church, walk in state to the Cathedral
church, at which there is a solemn service.</p>

<p>In 1824, the new governor, Don Gregorio Heras, gave
a grand dinner at the Fort: 120 sat down, including the
American minister, the English consul and two vice-consuls,
and many foreigners. The dessert was superb;
not like those we have, but chiefly of sweetmeats; sugar
castles, fortifications, and other designs made up of this
latter article.</p>

<p>Velarde gave a very comic description of the Fiestas, at
the theatre, in blank verse, in the character of a Gaucho,
seated with his companions round a fire, smoking, to whom
he is relating the events of the day, and, among the rest, of
the English sailor climbing the mast like a cat. This actor
displays abilities of no ordinary merit in this style of acting.</p>

<p>These four days passed without a single robbery, or
even the dread of such an event. Few cities in Europe
can boast as much, with a population of 60,000 persons.</p>

<p>It is said, that the diversions of the 25th of May, from
the expense, and uncertainty of the weather, are to be discontinued,
or at least postponed to another part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">-&nbsp;138&nbsp;-</a></span>
year. I hope they are not to be done away with. Some
few hours may surely be taken from the cares of life, and
devoted to enjoyment, in spite of the heartless censure of
the few.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to enter into an historical detail
of the political events that have agitated this country since
the declaration of its independence: they would alone
occupy more space than I have proposed to myself for
these Remarks. The notice of a few events, however,
connected with public affairs, since my residence in this
city, and of public men, may not be uninteresting in this
place.</p>

<p>The year 1820, in which I arrived, was remarkable
for its frequent political changes. Scarcely any of the
several chiefs, who rapidly succeeded each other at the
head of government, retained their power more than a
few weeks, till Don Martin Rodriguez, at the head of his
Colorados,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> or Red Men, (so named from the colour of their
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ponchos</i>, or cloaks), having succeeded in an attack upon
the town, put down the Civicas, or militia, who, although
appointed to preserve the peace of the city, by their frequent
insurrections, kept it in a constant state of agitation.
A battle was fought in the streets of the town, and many
lives were lost. He was finally confirmed Governor, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">-&nbsp;139&nbsp;-</a></span>
the 6th October, 1820, and continued in office for three
years, the period prescribed by law. Since that time the
government has assumed an appearance of stability, and
improvements have taken place in every department of the
administration.</p>

<p>Don Martin Rodriguez is a tall, well-looking man, and a
good soldier. Without the possession of any very shining
abilities, he has done more for the benefit of the state than
any of his predecessors, and retired from office with the
esteem of all parties. He was succeeded by Don <a id="Gregorio">Gregorio</a>
Heras, the present governor, in April, 1824.</p>

<p>During his government, Rodriguez owed much to the
able administration of Don Bernadino Rivadavia, who may
be considered the William Pitt of Buenos Ayres. He entered
office, as minister, in 1821, and left it with Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez;
the law requiring that ministers should resign,
or be re-elected, with the new governor. Mr. R. was
strenuously entreated to continue in his situation; but he
steadily refused, and his friends deplored the determination.
One of the first acts of his administration was to annihilate
privateering.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> By him the revenue was simplified and
increased; public plunderers could no longer escape detection;
and his firmness awed the disturbers of public peace,
and made the province respected by foreigners. In the
suppression of the monasteries, he encountered every species
of obloquy from a certain class. Now that passion has in
some degree subsided, his opponents, and even the priesthood,
must allow, that he had no other motive but his country&rsquo;s
good; and they cannot deny him the merit of disinterestedness
and unshaken resolution. Strangers of all
descriptions are grateful to him for the protection and attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">-&nbsp;140&nbsp;-</a></span>
he has shewn them, and the encouragement given
to their pursuits, which add to the capital and prosperity
of the country. The greatest eulogium that can be bestowed
upon Mr. Rivadavia&rsquo;s government is a comparison of Buenos
Ayres in 1821 and 1824, the periods when he accepted
and when he retired from office. His administration forms
an &aelig;ra in the political annals of the state, and will rank him
as an able&mdash;nay, more&mdash;an honest minister. His system, it
is said, will be strictly followed by his successors: I trust
it may, for the good of their country.</p>

<p>Mr. Rivadavia was bred to the law. He has been represented
to me as a man of strong passions, with nothing
of the courtier in his manners, which, at times, approach
to abruptness. The three years he was in office have
proved that he possesses first rate talents as a statesman.
Political as well as personal enemies every man must expect,
in a situation like his; and though such a consideration
might not have intimidated him from again accepting office,
very possibly it might have had some influence, conceiving,
that, as the foundation was laid for a good system of
government, they should not reproach him with clinging to
office for the sake of power and emolument.</p>

<p>Mr. Rivadavia has visited both France and England in
a public capacity, and has again sailed for Europe, in the
<i>Walsingham</i> packet, in part to superintend the education
of his son, who is now, I believe, in the college of Stonyhurst.
He will carry with him a distinguished name; before,
he was in a manner unknown. He speaks a little
English, and very good French.</p>

<p>In person, Mr. Rivadavia has some peculiarities; and
were he much before the public in London, I fear, he
would not long escape the wicked pencils of our caricaturists:
should it be so, he cannot complain; he will find
the king, and the first people in the realm, not spared by
them. His figure is short and thick, with a dark complexion;
and he generally walks with one arm behind him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">-&nbsp;141&nbsp;-</a></span>
wears black clothes, with tight pantaloons, displaying Herculean
limbs.</p>

<p>As an orator, Mr. Rivadavia is not very imposing; he
has a deep sonorous voice, and is eloquent&mdash;but not exactly
a Cicero.</p>

<p>In October, 1820, two persons were shot in the Plaza,
near the Fort, for state offences connected with the revolution
of the period&mdash;one a military officer, and the other a
drum-major. The former was executed in a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poncho</i>, in
which disguise he was taken. They were conducted from
the Fort in heavy irons, each holding a small cross, and
accompanied by friars on each side, to whom the criminals
eagerly listened. At the fatal spot their sentence was read:
they were placed on seats, and tied; the priests slowly withdrew,
still whispering comfort to the unhappy men; an
officer waved his handkerchief&mdash;and they were no more.
The band struck up the tune of &ldquo;The Downfall of Paris,&rdquo;
as the troops marched past the bodies. A number of
females witnessed the appalling sight from the neighbouring
balconies.</p>

<p>On the night or morning of the 19th March, 1823, an
attempt was made at another revolution, upon the plea
that the religion of the country was in danger. Gregorio
Tagl&eacute;, a lawyer, and a man of some talent, was the chief of
this conspiracy: he had been formerly one of the state
ministers; and, after its failure, he escaped to Colonia.
The disturbance began by some hundreds of Gauchos
from the country galloping into the town, shouting &ldquo;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Viva
la religion!</i>&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c. They overpowered the guard at the
Cabildo, released the prisoners, and began to toll the bell;
and at that hour (two o&rsquo;clock in the morning) it did certainly
frighten the town &ldquo;from its strict propriety.&rdquo; In the
Plaza they were received by a discharge of musquetry from
a few troops, who had advanced out of the Fort, and who,
after killing and wounding several, put the rest to the rout.
Garcia, a Colonel, implicated in the plot, was shot a few
days afterwards: he met his fate with firmness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">-&nbsp;142&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>This execution was followed by two more, those of
Colonel Peralto and Urien. The latter had been an officer
both in the Buenos-Ayrean and Peruvian services, and now
suffered for a participation in the conspiracy, and a murder
committed some years ago. He was in confinement at
the Cabildo, awaiting his sentence for the latter offence, and
being a relation of Mr. Rivadavia, interest was making to
save him, when the conspirators released him. Strict search
was made for the escaped criminal; and in a few days, he
surrendered himself, upon a promise of pardon on condition
of his making discoveries of those concerned in the late
conspiracy. Several were arrested upon his depositions;
amongst them, an English shopkeeper named Hargreaves,
whom he accused of selling fire-arms to the rioters at one
and two in the morning of the 19th March. An examination
proved that all the accusations were false: the accused
were released, and Urien desired to prepare for death.</p>

<p>Urien was well known in the coffee-houses of Buenos
Ayres; he was much in debt, and some of his creditors
were Englishmen. The murder of which he was convicted,
was committed in conjunction with a female, the
wife of the murdered man, and the body had been cut in
pieces, and buried at different times. Since the murder, he
had been in Peru, and had also lived in Buenos Ayres, unsuspicious
of discovery. Having a fine person and countenance,
he was a favourite with the ladies, and a complete
&ldquo;man upon town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The execution of Urien and Colonel Peralto took place
between ten and eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning: they
were conducted from the Cabildo prison, ironed, and under
a strong guard. They moved slowly along the Plazas to
the appointed spot, near the Fort, where they were both
uncovered, each holding a cross, and attended by priests:
the person of Urien attracted much attention, on account
of his tall figure, and dark expressive countenance. He
was dressed in a silk <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">levita</i>, or frock-coat, and walked unsupported,
and with great firmness; a smile now and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">-&nbsp;143&nbsp;-</a></span>
appeared upon his face, as he conversed with the priests.
He would have gained universal sympathy, but for his great
crimes; as it was, disgust was mingled with pity, that such
a man should be so guilty. The other wretched man,
Peralta, covered with a large great coat, with his head
bound up, and supported by his friends and the priests,
seemed the picture of misery. At the arch which parts the
Plazas, the sentence was read to the prisoners; and again
near the fatal place, at which it was some time ere they
arrived, from the slowness with which the procession
moved. Near the Fort, Urien eyed the artillerymen at
their guns, upon the ramparts: his resolution appeared to
falter, and he apparently wished to prolong the time at the
place of execution by conversation with those about him.
At length he was seated. His companion, during this
delay, had taken his seat, and, at this last trying moment,
was more composed than Urien. The soldiers fired:
Peralta fell dead; but Urien still kept his seat, appearing
only slightly wounded. The drums, which began to beat,
were stopped, and a horrible scene ensued. Several soldiers
placed their musquets at the head of Urien: they missed
fire, one after the other; at last, one exploded, which, from
the report it made, could only have been slightly charged.
The poor wretch fell upon the ground, but was not dead;
and he endeavoured to raise himself up upon his elbow.
Other musquets were discharged, and Urien moved no
more. The feelings of the spectators, during this appalling
spectacle, may well be conceived. The hearse and coffin
were in attendance; and, after the troops had passed, the
bodies were placed in them, and taken for interment. A
great concourse attended the execution. Peralta was much
pitied, having borne an excellent character. The ceremony
altogether was terrible; and the part in which the magistrate
reads the sentence appears singular to a stranger: a
man repeats every word after him in a loud voice; he is
selected, I presume, for this qualification.</p>

<p>Jos&eacute; Miguel Carrera, so conspicuous in the revolutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">-&nbsp;144&nbsp;-</a></span>
of this part of South America, was shot, at Mendoza, in
1821. He was a Chilian by birth, and belonged to one of
the first families there: he was a man of considerable
abilities. The execution of his two brothers, Antonio and
Luis, in that same city, and other political affairs, had made
him vow eternal enmity to the government of Buenos Ayres;
particularly to San Martin, whom he much disliked. In
his vengeance, he had raised the Indians to assist him.
This act lost him many of his friends, who now viewed him
with a kind of horror, as chief of barbarians. He was betrayed
into the hands of his enemies, and immediately put
to death, which, it is almost needless to observe, he underwent
with courage, and was buried, it is said, in the same
grave with the brothers he so dearly loved.</p>

<p>Carrera was in the prime of life, tall, and elegantly
formed: his desperation and courage rank him as one of
Lord Byron&rsquo;s heroes, though not exactly &ldquo;with one virtue
linked to a thousand crimes.&rdquo; His widow (who has
been a fine woman), and infant family, I afterwards saw at
Buenos Ayres. One of the latter, a little girl not five
years of age, was imprudently asked, in my presence, what
had become of her father? &ldquo;Murdered by the Mendoceans,&rdquo;
she quickly replied.</p>

<p>San Martin, having retired from public life, embarked at
Buenos Ayres for France and England, attended by his
daughter. His wife, one of the daughters of the late
Se&ntilde;or Escalada, died a short time since in this city. San
Martin is a tall, stout man, about forty-five years of age:
he is said to be rich. He has his detractors; however,
they cannot deny him one great military qualification, that
of a determined mind. In his dispute with Lord Cochrane,
the latter had decidedly the best of the argument, judging
from a pamphlet which his lordship has published.</p>

<p>The late General Belgrano, a native of this province, and
who distinguished himself in several actions against the
Spaniards, has a day set apart for funereal rites: it takes
place in June, the anniversary of his death.</p>

<p>In the month of October, 1824, the visit of a New-Zealand
chief to Buenos Ayres, by name Tippah&eacute;e Cupa,
attracted much curiosity; he arrived in the British ship
<i>Urania</i>, Captain Reynolds. Tippah&eacute;e came alongside
this ship in Cook&rsquo;s Straits, with a war canoe filled with his
people, and, in spite of the remonstrances and even force
used by Captain R. refused to quit the vessel, expressing
his determination to proceed to England. He bade his
followers an affectionate adieu, enjoining obedience to his
successor during his absence. The <i>Urania</i> sailed for
London with her passenger the 8th December, 1824.</p>

<p>Tippah&eacute;e, when he first arrived in Buenos Ayres, was
clothed in an old red coat, formerly belonging to a London
postman. The English paid him many attentions, inviting
him to dine at their houses, and new clothing him. His
behaviour at table was easy and unembarrassed; and, when
requested, he would perform the dances and war songs of
New Zealand. He understood a little of the English
language, and spoke a few words of it; his intelligent
manners, and circumspect conduct, rendered him an universal
favourite. On the map he could trace the ship&rsquo;s
course from New Zealand to Lima and Buenos Ayres. He
knew an Englishman immediately; the Spaniards he did
not much admire, fancying they viewed him with contempt,
and was glad to get among Englishmen. His age is about
forty; he possesses amazing strength; his tattooed face and
appearance always attracted a crowd after him in Buenos
Ayres. On board ship he was found very useful, doing
all sorts of work, but he positively declined to go aloft. The
fate of Captain Thompson, and the crew of the British
ship <i>Boyd</i>, ought to bespeak caution in using coercion
with these savage chieftains of New Zealand. In Cruise&rsquo;s
book of New Zealand, Tippahee was shewn a picture of
a chief of his country, with which he was greatly delighted.
The object of his journey to England is to solicit arms and
ammunition, to place him upon a par with a rival chief,
who possesses those requisites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">-&nbsp;146&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>At the dinner given on St. Andrew&rsquo;s day, in December,
1824, by the Scotch gentlemen, Mr. Parish, the British
consul, hinted at the speedy acknowledgment of the independence
of Buenos Ayres by his government. This intimation
was received with great enthusiasm by a numerous
company, among whom were the principal members of
government.</p>

<p>The <i>Camden</i> packet took home the treaty between the
British and Buenos-Ayrean governments, with several passengers,
including Mr. Griffiths, one of the vice-consuls,
and Mr. Nunez, a Creolian gentleman, secretary to Mr.
Rivadavia. The <i>Lord Hobart</i> packet took home passenger
Mr. M&lsquo;<!--yes, backward apostrophe-->Crackan, many years a merchant in this country,
and a worthy man.</p>

<p>Don Carlos Alvear, and Don Felix Castro, have proceeded
to England from Buenos Ayres: the former makes
it on his way to the United States of North America, to
which he is appointed minister. Their mission to London
is supposed to have reference to the loan about negotiating.
The security to British capitalists is surely as good, if not
better than in many other cases in which they have lent
money. There are no restrictions upon interest: the
average has been 12 per cent.; but this is decreasing.</p>

<p>Alvear was formerly a director of Buenos Ayres, and is
a very active man. In the early part of his life, he narrowly
escaped destruction, when going to Spain in one of the
Spanish frigates captured, in 1804, by Captain Graham
Moore. The frigate in which he had taken his passage
was one that blew up, and he had only left it prior to the
action, to pay a visit on board another ship: some of his
nearest relatives perished in the explosion.</p>

<p>Should Alvear harbour any dislike to our country, it may
be attributed to this shocking catastrophe; but, I am persuaded,
his good sense has, long ere this, made him view it
as one of the accidents inseparable from the quarrel of
nations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">-&nbsp;147&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening of the 21st January,
1825, an express entered Buenos Ayres with news of
the battle of Ayacucho, in Peru. A victory so decisive
and unexpected caused a tumult of joy: people crowded
round the coffee-houses, listening to the different orators
describing the victory; it brought to one&rsquo;s recollection
the crowds at the newspaper offices in London, upon
similar occasions. At ten o&rsquo;clock at night, a triple salute
was fired from the Fort, which was answered by another
from the <i>Aranzazu</i> brig of war, anchored in the inner
roads, and a Brazilian brig of war. Partial illuminations
and fire-works took place the same evening.</p>

<p>On the 22d January, there was a performance at the
theatre, when the national hymn was sung, amidst loud
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">vivas</i> for Bolivar, Sucre, &amp;c.; and Colonel Ramirez read
the official detail to the audience from the boxes. The
theatre was decorated with silks and national emblems,
and illuminated with extra lights: an ode upon the victory
was sold at the doors, and a military band stationed
there.</p>

<p>The rejoicings continued for three nights, with bonfires,
illuminations, and military music in the gallery of the
Cabildo; the pyramid in the Plaza was illuminated, and
surrounded by transparencies, &amp;c. The people seemed
mad with joy; I could scarcely have believed them capable
of such enthusiasm; and though, perhaps, these ebullitions
are not at all times to be taken as a test of patriotism, yet
I am persuaded, the mass of the people sincerely rejoiced.</p>

<p>The Coffee-house de la Victoria was thronged both
inside and out; and wine and beer were drank in profusion.
Various toasts were given, amongst which was &ldquo;Religious
Toleration.&rdquo; There was abundance of speechifying, describing
the past and the future, with the happiness in
reserve for the inhabitants of the province of the Rio de
la Plata. Some hundreds formed themselves into military
array, and, with banners and music, proceeded through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">-&nbsp;148&nbsp;-</a></span>
the streets, singing the national hymn, and shouting opposite
the houses of known patriots with loud <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">vivas</i>. At the residence
of the British Consul they cheered for England, the
King of England, and liberty. At the American minister&rsquo;s,
similar compliments were bestowed on North America.
Colonel Forbes invited them inside, and pledged them in
bumpers of wine. During the whole of the night the assemblage
continued in the streets, with music and singing; yet
but few irregularities took place. Some violent spirits declaimed
against the Brazilians, and, it is said, windows
were broken at the Brazilian Consul&rsquo;s house;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> but this
act was quickly discountenanced by the rest. In fact, they
have nothing here which can put one in mind of a mob,
especially an English mob. The bands that paraded the
streets were composed of the most genteel young men
of the town. A young man named Saravia is looked up
to as a sort of leader and manager on these popular occasions;
possessing abundance of wit, activity, a tolerable
share of oratory, and staunch patriotism, Saravia plays no
insignificant part in the politics of Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>Public dinners were given at Faunch&rsquo;s Hotel. Eighty
Creolian gentlemen sat down to an entertainment of this
description. The dining-room was decorated with flags
of all nations, portraits of Bolivar, Sucre, &amp;c.; and military
music was in attendance, which played &ldquo;God save the
King!&rdquo; upon the King of England&rsquo;s health being proposed.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">-&nbsp;149&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Another dinner was given by Don Gregorio Heras, the
governor, at the house of the Consulado, in the same style
and splendour, and rivalling even London itself. The bumper
toasts were numerous and appropriate.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>A subscription ball and supper was likewise given by some
of the Buenos Ayrean gentlemen, at the Consulado. English
and other foreigners attended in considerable numbers.
The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patio</i>, or court-yard, covered by an awning, and
brilliantly decorated, was devoted to dancing: the concourse
of ladies was very great, who, by their style of
dancing and charming attire, rendered the scene exceedingly
fascinating, upon a par with any such amusements in
Europe. The dancing continued all night, and until
nearly seven o&rsquo;clock on the Sunday morning, not having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">-&nbsp;150&nbsp;-</a></span>
any Bishop of London or sanctified gentry to interfere.
Unfortunately, the night proved intensely hot. The supper
table was laid out in the grand saloon.</p>

<p>The North-American gentlemen resident in Buenos
Ayres, on the 23d February, 1825, gave a similar entertainment
at the same building, the Consulado, in honour
of the victory of Ayacucho, and of Washington&rsquo;s birth-day.
Having more time for preparation, and the evening
being cool it was the most superb affair ever seen in this
country; and as regarded effect, it could hardly be surpassed.
The awning was arranged in the form of a dome;
and the walls of the court-yard in which the dance was
held were covered with flags: Buenos Ayrean, Peruvian,
Chilian, British, and American, were most conspicuous.
The glare of light falling on these colours, with the sylph-like
movements of the ladies mingling in the dance, made
all appear enchantment, realizing the fables of Eastern
romance. &ldquo;London cannot beat this!&rdquo; exclaimed a
John Bull just arrived from England, as he entered the
scene of festivity: the graceful attitudes and appearance
of the female part of the company evidently surprised
him. The music was of the first description; Masoni
and other professors presiding. It was the first entertainment
given in this country by the North Americans
to the Buenos Ayres public; and they certainly succeeded
to the utmost, reflecting the highest honour upon their
liberality and patriotism. It may be said that &ldquo;all the
world&rdquo; of Buenos Ayres was there, and they did not
separate until seven o&rsquo;clock the next morning. The exterior
of the Consulado was illuminated, with the names
of <i>Washington</i>, <i>Bolivar</i>, <i>Sucre</i>.</p>

<p>The substantial part of these different entertainments
was superintended by Faunch, the English hotel keeper,
the only man in this country competent to the undertaking:
his arrangements would not disgrace Messrs. Gunter and
Debatt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">-&nbsp;151&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>The town was illuminated during the three nights of
Carnival. In the Plaza, the names of the South-American
heroes blazed from the &ldquo;Casa de Policia.&rdquo; The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rompe
cabeza</i> (or break head), greased masts, and other sports,
took place; two military bands of music playing alternately.
The weather being fine, added to the pleasure; the streets
and Plaza were filled with people. I viewed the scene
as an event, perhaps, never to occur again&mdash;I mean as to
such a continuance of enthusiasm and festivals; and, like
Noodle and Doodle, &ldquo;as we never saw the like before,
&rsquo;tis fit we make the most of it.&rdquo; I had, too, my forebodings,
and was not quite so sanguine as to the future moral
happiness of the country: for as population increases, its
attendants, crime and misery, follow.</p>

<p>The theatre was open the three nights; the national
hymn was sung, the house decorated, &amp;c. The British
consul, with his suite, attended on one of the nights of
Carnival; and on the Sunday, went in state from the Fort
to the Cathedral church. All the public officers were in
the train, including the foreign consuls. It was a walking
procession; and Mr. Poussett, the British vice-consul,
walked with Mr. Slacum, the North-American consul.
Some forty or fifty years back, who could have dreamt
of such an event&mdash;a British consul joining in a procession
with a consul of her colonies, now independent, to celebrate
the independence of another part of the American continent.</p>

<p>Buenos Ayres illuminations are of a very inferior description,
a candle or two placed in each window; no
tasteful transparencies. The house of Mr. Losana was
an exception: he had a transparency of the British
and North American national arms, and an incessant
rattling of fire-works (crackers) from the roof and windows
of his mansion.</p>

<p>On the 24th February, a triumphal car was paraded
through the streets, followed by a piece of artillery, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">-&nbsp;152&nbsp;-</a></span>
another car containing arms of all descriptions, the whole
preceded by persons bearing torches, and military music.
The grand car was adorned with flags: the British flag
I did not observe amongst them. When the cavalcade
reached the Plaza, it was overtaken by a Pampero wind,
with the usual accompaniment of dust, obscuring the
atmosphere, and obliging shops and windows to be instantly
closed. The London pickpockets, during these
squalls would find ample field for their talents.</p>

<p>During the rejoicings for the Ayacucho victory, the
<i>Aranzazu</i> brig of war had the flag of old Spain floating
under that of Buenos Ayres.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Concluding Remarks</span>.&mdash;The great want of this country
is population; and until it is increased by an industrious
race, agriculture will remain at its present low ebb;
and they will have no sure defence against distant enemies,
powerful neighbours, and the ravages of the Indians. It
would be advantageous to encourage emigration from the
over-peopled countries of Europe, give them protection and
an interest in the country; then Buenos Ayres may reach
those high destinies which her sanguine politicians pretend
to see in perspective; but it is not by simple talking, that
this is to be done. England reached her present greatness
by degrees, and by various sacrifices. I am aware that
many in Buenos Ayres view the influx of strangers with
jealousy, and talk very highly of their powerful means, &amp;c.
But, setting aside the old adage, that &ldquo;boasters do the
least,&rdquo; what could protect them, if an alteration should
take place in European politics, and any one of the states
of Europe, without fear of obstruction, should determine
to appropriate the province of Buenos Ayres to itself?
The 150,000 men, women, and children, that now inhabit
it, would stand a miserable chance against the hordes
that would be then let loose upon them. Therefore, an
increase of population, having all the rights of citizens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">-&nbsp;153&nbsp;-</a></span>
would be an increase of power; and, in defence of their
property and homes, they would all join heart and hand
to drive the spoilers from their adopted land.</p>

<p>If, however, an attack from any European power be
considered an event too distant or improbable to create
any apprehension, Buenos Ayres has a more immediate
danger to provide against, from an enemy whose attacks
are neither problematical nor easily to be parried. This
province is unfortunately exposed to the ravages of the
Indians, who murder the inhabitants, and carry off the
cattle, spreading desolation and terror around. They are
frequently within a hundred miles of the city, and in
1823 they approached much nearer. They advance in
general, from the S. or S.E. quarter, in bodies of 3, 4, 5,
and 600, armed with spear and lasso. In using the
last, they are almost sure to entrap the unfortunates
within their reach. The forces opposed to them appear
inadequate; the horses, unable to endure the hardships of
such a campaign, have not been found equal to those
of the Indians; and as prisoners taken by them seldom
meet with mercy, it has inspired timidity. When likely
to be hard pressed, the Indians disperse in all directions,
flying to their inaccessible retreats. The late Governor
Rodriguez headed several expeditions against them, but
without any marked success.</p>

<p>Four officers of Buenos Ayres, in 1823, were sent with
a message to the Indians, who were detained and murdered.
One of them, a Polish gentleman, named Bullicusque,
had been in Napoleon&rsquo;s army, and was much esteemed.
He had some talent at caricature: one which he made
of Mr. Rivadavia attempting to climb the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Rompe Cabeza</i>,
in allusion to the suppression of the Friars, caused some
mirth.</p>

<p>That any portion of the civilized part of South America
should, at this period, be held in terror by Indians,
is a disgrace to Spanish management, after 350 years of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">-&nbsp;154&nbsp;-</a></span>
possession. The East Indies, and its hundred millions
of people subject to British sway, present rather a different
spectacle: they are in peace, and under the protection
of the laws; the once powerful Mahratta nation, the
Pindarees, and other warlike tribes having been subdued
or conciliated within our time. The suppression of the
predatory Indians about this province is a legacy left by
the Spaniards to their late colonists.</p>

<p>The Indians of South America are, in persons and countenance,
a striking contrast to those of Africa. They have
long black hair, flat faces, short thick persons, and complexions
of the mulatto cast, without any thing in their
countenances to denote ferocity, judging from those I have
seen in the streets of Buenos Ayres as prisoners. They
have a slight clothing, but it is very filthy. The woolly
hair and tawny skin are not seen amongst them. They
are much attached to their <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caciques</i>, or chiefs.</p>

<p>In the present state of the province, it is a question
whether it would not be sound policy to take into pay
3 or 4000 foreign troops, and, by placing them in cantonments
on the exposed frontiers, awe the Indians, and give
the state a greater respect with other nations.</p>

<p>Every Buenos Ayrean who really loves his country, will
view the arrival of a settler emigrant amongst them more
as a benefit than an injury.</p>

<p>Some of my countrymen are of opinion, that the acknowledgment
of the independence of Buenos Ayres by the
British government will induce many to emigrate from
home, and thus add to the strength, industry, and capital
of this province. I should rejoice at such an occurrence;
our England, Ireland, and Scotland, can well spare from
their too numerous population.</p>

<p>But, unless a person has some settled object of business,
Buenos Ayres will not prove the most eligible place to
speculate upon for employment.</p>

<p>Clerks, unless they possess strong recommendations, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">-&nbsp;155&nbsp;-</a></span>
come expressly engaged, had better not venture upon the
voyage: they will, in all probability, meet with great disappointment.
The mercantile houses have their clerks
sent from the firms at home; little chance in that capacity,
therefore, remains for others. Many have returned to England,
finding that to continue here was only making bad
worse.</p>

<p>It is professions of the first necessity that succeed.
Mechanics are sure of employment, and with prudence
can save money. A journeyman carpenter may earn, by
piece-work, four to five dollars per day; their regular wages
from the English masters are from forty to forty-five and
forty-eight dollars per month. Braziers, blacksmiths, &amp;c.
do well: Englishmen have shops in all those branches.
Labourers of all descriptions are in request.</p>

<p>Farming I do not conceive a profitable concern: labour
is high, and the foreign farmer, from the sort of men he
must employ, is continually exposed to petty thefts, the
punishment of which causes great annoyance and trouble.
English labourers generally manage to leave their master
the moment they become useful. Several Englishmen have
tried the system of farming, without much success; it is more
adapted to the natives, and, from what I have heard, they
make nothing extraordinary of it. It is possible that a
man with a capital of 800 to 1000<i>l.</i> may more than live;
but it ought to be a strong temptation to induce an individual
with that property to leave his country, and to be well assured
of the probable advantages of such an experiment. At
the present moment a rapid fortune is not to be made as
a farmer; he must be content to plod on for years, with
great anxiety, and labour to boot. The soil, rich as it is,
requires artificial aid.</p>

<p>It is in holding <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">estancias</i>, or grazing farms, that money has
been made; and from the high price of hides, and the continual
demand for them, this affords every prospect of
advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">-&nbsp;156&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>Emigrants will not find the conveniences they have at
home, but as many comforts as they can possibly expect
in a foreign land, including the favourable climate.</p>

<p>An English female, upon her first arrival in this country
would not find herself very comfortable; it must take some
time to reconcile her to the loss of home, dress, mode
of living&mdash;every thing so different; the only alleviation is in
the society of her country folks, and the kind behaviour of the
people, which will soon soften those feelings, and when somewhat
conversant in the language, she would become attached
to Spanish society, from whom she may be assured of receiving
the most delicate attentions that hospitality can prompt.</p>

<p>A person will not be long in Buenos Ayres without
picking up acquaintances with its inhabitants; amongst
whom are some very intelligent young men. I have sometimes
thought it would give me pleasure to conduct one of
them to England, to be&mdash;not exactly a Mentor (needing
that myself), but a sort of escort to him in the modern
Babylon, London; to explain its many varieties, from the
mansions of the nobility, down to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">fondas</i> of St. Giles&rsquo;s,
where plates, knives, and forks, are chained to the tables, to
prevent the customers walking off with them.</p>

<p>Common report asserts, that a strong French faction
exists in Buenos Ayres. I will not pretend to offer an
opinion upon this. Three years ago, I thought there was
a decided leaning towards France: but I do not think
there is so much now. If it were only for the sake of
consistency, they must be ashamed of French politics, and
the war in Spain, undertaken, as &ldquo;an experiment to try
the fidelity of the French army,&rdquo; according to Monsieur
Chateaubriand, who asserted that a few months campaigning
had done more good for France than years of peace.
That a portion of the inhabitants may be attached to the
French, is probable; their manners and religion assimilate
more than ours. An Englishman is looked upon as a
strange creature, different from the rest of the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">-&nbsp;157&nbsp;-</a></span>
Other nations have not that characteristic of country (excepting
the North Americans): a Frenchman, Italian, &amp;c.
mixes in the crowd as one of the country in which he
resides, and is scarcely recognized as a foreigner; but
nature seems to have placed her peculiar mark upon us,
and, in conjunction with our law against expatriation, seems
to assert, that &ldquo;once an Englishman, always an Englishman.&rdquo;
It would appear that strangers can almost discover
us blindfold: often, on the darkest night, I have been
accosted by boys and others as an Englishman.</p>

<p>The old Spanish part of the population, I dare say,
dislike, and can never forgive us; we are ever the subject
of their sneering remarks, and must expect to be so. That
we can act from principles of pure honour, appears to
them impossible; and they affect to trace self-interest at
the bottom of all our professions, particularly as to the
proceedings of the British government toward South
America, which have gained us so much popularity with
those states; and given British politics the lead, which
indeed never stood more high in Buenos Ayres than at
the present moment.</p>

<p>Englishmen are aware that very few like them as a nation,
however they may respect them as individuals; and should
our country be once on the wane, there would be plenty
of helping hands to press us further down. It requires
no extraordinary sagacity to account for this animosity.
I am certain, however, we have numerous friends in Buenos
Ayres. The rising generation have, in a manner, grown
up with us. Time will wear away antiquated prejudices,
and it will be seen that the calumnies which have been
heaped upon our nation for ages, have not been deserved.
Many fine young Englishmen reside in Buenos Ayres in
mercantile and other employments: this portion associate
a great deal with the inhabitants, with whom they have
formed a perfect intimacy.</p>

<p>I do not expect emigration from England yet, to any great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">-&nbsp;158&nbsp;-</a></span>
extent. The English people, in general, have a repugnance
to live under foreign laws, and where the influence
of a religion prevails which from childhood they have
been taught to believe is inimical to their own. But,
waving these considerations, they would have little else to
complain of. Here is a rich soil, without any dread of
sands and blights, as at the Cape of Good Hope; and if
they cannot amass a fortune, they are sure to live, and that
comfortably. Of the kind-hearted inhabitants I have
already spoken: my countrymen may be assured, there
are no foreigners with whom he will find himself so much
at home as with the Buenos Ayreans. Therefore, I again
repeat, that farmers with a small capital may gain a livelihood&mdash;perhaps,
more; labourers are sure of constant employment;
and mechanics are ever in request. The climate
is congenial; the government are their sure protectors;
and the people, in spite of every prejudice, esteem our
nation. The age of revolutions, I think, is past; and,
during their utmost violence, strangers were never molested.
British vessels from Liverpool are continually
arriving: and the cost of the passage is moderate.</p>

<p>Whenever fate conducts me from this country, I shall
quit it with regret for any other place but my native
home, and must always feel the most sincere esteem and
gratitude towards the fine and generous people amongst
whom I have so long resided, and where I have enjoyed
happiness I little thought to experience out of Great
Britain. I came to Buenos Ayres somewhat prejudiced,
expecting to observe illiberality and bigotry, in place of the
many amiable qualities of which I have found them possessed;
and although I am as complete an home-sick Englishman
as ever quitted his paternal shores, yet such is my attachment
to Buenos Ayres, that I look up to it as my second

<h2><a name="COLONIA_DEL_SACRAMENTO" id="COLONIA_DEL_SACRAMENTO">COLONIA DEL SACRAMENTO.</a></h2>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p>I <small>VISITED</small> Colonia del Sacramento for a short period. It
lies east of Buenos Ayres, distant across the river thirty
miles, and may sometimes be seen from the latter city:
when this is the case, it denotes a change of weather to
wind or rain.</p>

<p>Colonia is fortified both on the land and sea side:
heavy guns are mounted on the lines, and it is capable of
making a good defence. It is now in the possession of the
Brazilian government. In December, 1821, during my
abode there, it was occupied by the Portuguese, and 600
European troops constituted the garrison; they were all light
infantry, and had served in the Peninsular war. I should
suppose them a &ldquo;crack regiment,&rdquo; for in appearance they
fully equalled British troops: the uniform, brown jackets
with black facings, and caps similar to our&rsquo;s. Most of the
officers wore orders for services in Europe. The music
consisted of bugle trumpets. Parade every morning:
officers marched to their guard, colours trooped, and all
the evolutions of the parade in St. James&rsquo;s Park. On Sundays
they mustered in their best uniform, governor attending,
for church. I could not but express my admiration,
at the fine order and discipline of the troops, to a Portuguese
officer. He answered, that whatever improvement
had taken place, was entirely owing to British example and
instruction; that we had found them a mob, and transformed
them to decent soldiers. It will be long ere Spain can put
forth such troops.</p>

<p>The officers, in Colonia, were good-looking gentlemanly
men, speaking a little French and English, picked up in
campaigning. Many of them had married, and preferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">-&nbsp;160&nbsp;-</a></span>
remaining in the country, when the regiment was ordered
away, turning farmers, cattle dealers, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The governor (Rodriguez) is a veteran of the Peninsula.
Strangers, upon their arrival, are introduced to him. I
found him working in his garden, at a cottage, near the
town: he received me with great civility. How strangely
the Spanish and Portuguese character has been represented
to us at home! I cannot discover that assumption of dignity
and pride attributed to them; on the contrary, they are of
very amiable manners.</p>

<p>In Colonia, the soldiers were much esteemed, and industrious
men. A comparison with those of Buenos
Ayres would be invidious.</p>

<p>The officers must have had a monotonous life, in so dull
a place as Colonia. They were great favourites with the
ladies; and, in riding about the country, visiting, and
dancing, whiled away their spare time.</p>

<p>The soldiers were quartered in different houses: their
behaviour reminded me of the domestic character of our
troops; I observed them nursing children, and busily employed
about the house, with nothing of that swaggering
consequence so usual with foreign troops. The Duke of
Wellington discovered and rightly appreciated their merits,
which have brought such renown upon the military annals
of Portugal.</p>

<p>The world are accustomed to speak very slightingly of
the Portuguese character as a nation; and when the deeds
in the Peninsula have been mentioned, it has been said,
&ldquo;they have fought well, because British bayonets were at
their backs.&rdquo; Those same British have done the Portuguese
army the justice their bravery deserves; and the
pitiful sneers of their calumniatos will fall harmless.</p>

<p>Our saucy sailors, too, in the plenitude of their impudence,
must have their joke at the Portuguese: I remember,
upon my first trip to sea, I was called from the cabin
to look at a Portuguese man-of-war, which, they told me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">-&nbsp;161&nbsp;-</a></span>
had just hove in sight: I did look, but no vessel was to be
seen. At last, the sailors pointed out to me a nautilus, with
all sail set, skimming along the water which they asserted,
was a Portuguese ship of the line.</p>

<p>Colonia has about 800 inhabitants. There are very few
good houses: the greater part may be called huts, and are
occupied by a mixture of South Americans, old Spaniards,
Portuguese, and some half-dozen of Englishmen married
to South-American ladies.</p>

<p>The governor&rsquo;s house is a very ordinary building. The
streets are irregular; and the town altogether presents a
most miserable appearance.</p>

<p>The town cannot afford a tavern; there is only a paltry
billiard-room, in a public house, to which the Portuguese
officers resorted.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Colonia are very hospitable. I attended
a birth-day feast, at one of their <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quintas</i>; forty persons
sat down to a dinner of beef, fowls, turkey, pastry, &amp;c.
The wine went merrily round, under a continual call for
<i>bompas</i> (bumpers); and after dinner, there was dancing.
Some Portuguese officers were present, with their young
Spanish wives.</p>

<p>At those dinner parties, they have a practice of throwing
bits of bread at each other; and I felt some degree of surprise
at first receiving those bread shots.</p>

<p>The captain of the port, Mr. Short, is an Englishman,
belonging to the Portuguese navy, and is very attentive to
his countrymen, whom business may call there: the same
may be said of Mr. Bridgman, who has been many years resident
in the town.</p>

<p>Colonia has but little trade. Small craft from Monte
Video and Buenos Ayres, bound up the river to Paysan
Lee, &amp;c. and sometimes British and other vessels call in,
to ship produce. A vessel can anchor within a quarter of
a mile from the shore, in 3&frac12; fathom water. The harbour
is good, considering the bad anchorage of this river. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">-&nbsp;162&nbsp;-</a></span>
is a constant communication overland with Monte Video;
the distance is about 150 miles. To load vessels of any
burthen, craft are sent from Buenos Ayres. There is a
dangerous reef near the harbour, on which a British brig
(the <i>Euxine</i>) was wrecked, in March, 1824.</p>

<p>Our ships of war, stationed in the outer roads of Buenos
Ayres, send their boats for brush-wood to the Island of
St. Gabriel, near Colonia. The church is a conspicuous
land-mark, and looks very much like an English country
church, in its exterior; the interior has nothing of splendour
to boast&mdash;no organ, or decorations; the service is confided
to some poor old priests, who are fast approaching their
earthly end.</p>

<p>If Colonia in itself has nothing attractive, the country
around makes ample amends, being interspersed with small
hills, dales, lakes, and agreeable rides&mdash;affording a fine
field to the sportsman. The prospect of the river is uninterrupted,
assuming the appearance of a perfect sea.
Here is every facility for bathing: the water is clear and
bracing. This side of the river, in point of scenery, is far
beyond the Buenos Ayrean: an Englishman, however, regards
it with almost equal indifference. If any particular
view is pointed out, Sussex, Kent, Devonshire, crowd upon
his thoughts; in comparison with which, the flat coast and
few diminutive hills of this part of South America appear
insignificant.</p>

<p>In the environs of Colonia are many comfortable <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quintas</i>,
or farm-houses. Provisions are dearer than in Buenos
Ayres, and the beef is not so good.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood are found the birds called cardinals,
from having a tuft of feathers upon their heads shaped
like a cardinal&rsquo;s hat. Their plumage is pretty; and they
sing. Care is required to convey them safe to Europe.</p>

<p>The air plant is a singular production of this place; it
grows on bushes, and will thrive in the open air, without
the aid of mould.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">-&nbsp;163&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>I think it possible, a few years hence, that Colonia may
start from its present inferiority, and take a station commensurate
with the advantages it possesses as a port in the
river Plate. It was occupied by a division of our army in
1807. History reminds us of our countryman, Penrose,
and the mishaps he encountered here in 1762.</p>

<p>Lately, the church and several houses have been damaged,
and some lives lost, by the blowing up of a magazine of
gunpowder.</p>

<p>The occupation of the Banda Oriental by the Portuguese,
and now by the Brazilians, has been the subject of a strong
remonstrance from the government of Buenos Ayres. The
<a id="original">original</a> plea of the disturbed state of the country, and
danger thereby to the neighbouring Brazilian provinces,
no longer existing, Don Valentin Gomez<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> was sent to Rio
Janeiro, but returned without accomplishing his object.
The Brazilian flag still waves, and is likely to do so, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">-&nbsp;164&nbsp;-</a></span>
the fortresses of Monte Video, Colonia, Maldonado, and
the adjacent country. I am not aware upon what arguments
the Brazilians determine to keep their hold, excepting
possibly that of &ldquo;might constituting right.&rdquo; Buenos
Ayres would seem its more natural protector. A portion
of the inhabitants, it is likely, prefer that the country should
remain under its present masters, satisfied with the manner
in which authority has been exercised, and dreading revolutions.</p>

<p>The old Spanish part of the population bear no particular
love to the Patriots: of the two, it is doubtful which they
hate most, the Patriots or the English.</p>

<p>Buenos Ayres would find it difficult to dislodge the
Brazilians by force, though there are advocates for this
measure. Prudence, I trust, will guide their resolves; and
if injustice has been perpetrated, let revenge be deferred
until it can be securely taken. The separation, after centuries
of fellowship, and falling under foreign dominion,
must be galling.</p>

<p>If Buenos Ayres held the Banda Oriental, she would be
a powerful state, which it is the policy of the court of Rio de
Janeiro to prevent. Its fortresses, fine climate and country,
improving population, influx of emigrants, under a strong
government, would make even the empire of Brazil to look
about them. However, such an event is distant; every thing
leads me to think its present occupants will long keep possession.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1" href="#FNanchor_1_1" class="label">[1]</a> The
unsettled state of the country formerly deterred masters of vessels
from giving up their registers, fearing they might be lost; and various
shifts were resorted to as substitutes, such as rendering Mediterranean
passes, apprentice indentures, any thing in the shape of parchment or
printing&mdash;all went current. Some years since, Matthews, an adjutant of the
port, who had been aid-de-camp to Admiral Gravina, at the battle of Trafalgar,
detected a trick of this sort, the parties not being aware that he
understood English. Matthews was a Spaniard born, but educated in
London.</p>

the 4th December, 1823, the Dutch ship of war <i>Lynx</i>, of 30 guns,
arrived at Buenos Ayres, on her way to the Pacific; and thirty of the crew
deserted, during her stay of nineteen days. The boats came on shore latterly
with armed marines, and the men were not permitted to land.</p>

<p>The French brig of war <i>Faune</i> arrived on the 11th, and sailed on the
23d June, 1824: she lost six men by desertion. This brig brought to
Buenos Ayres the French Admiral, Rosamel.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4" href="#FNanchor_4_4" class="label">[4]</a> In
the coffee-houses, the waiters are very inquisitive, and in a manner
that one cannot be angry with. A knight of the napkin got me into conversation,
asking me a host of questions about England and Englishmen,
declaring, that he liked them better than any foreigners; and, after passing
those compliments, which I received with due reverence, he eagerly demanded
the reason of the English having such red faces? I knew he could
not mean mine, as I am dark, and of a sallow complexion; so I told him,
that the rich people drank a great deal of Port wine, and the poor equally
so of beer, which accounted for the bloom he had noticed.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5" href="#FNanchor_5_5" class="label">[5]</a> As
Mr. R. is an important personage in Buenos Ayres, I cannot forbear
relating an anecdote of him:&mdash;In an excursion to Rio Janeiro, he took away
with him a slave girl, reporting (or scandal had done so for him) that she
was a present from the governor&rsquo;s lady, as a trifling reward for the pleasure
his musical talents had afforded her. This coming to the ears of the lady
made her highly indignant, saying, that &ldquo;she was not in the habit of giving
away her slaves.&rdquo; Rosquellas, upon his return, was sent to prison, and
made to account for the slave, by paying a round sum of money.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6" href="#FNanchor_6_6" class="label">[6]</a> I
once witnessed a most disgraceful scene at the Theatre Fran&ccedil;ais, at
Paris. Talma was performing <cite>Cinna</cite>&mdash;the house was crowded, when some
English ladies entered the boxes, escorted by two of their countrymen,
military officers. It was at the time when the British army occupied Paris.
In taking off their shawls, the backs of the ladies were, for a moment,
turned towards the pit; when a yelling commenced from that quarter,
which would have disgraced savages. The interference of the British
officers increased the confusion; the most insulting gestures were resorted
to; and the ladies quitted the theatre in tears, affording a noble triumph
to those brave champions of etiquette.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7" href="#FNanchor_7_7" class="label">[7]</a> A
performance was advertised for a benefit, founded upon the battle of
Salamanca. In the front of the theatre, on the evening previous, a transparency
was exhibited, representing the discomfited French pursued by
Wellington and his troop: they had, likewise, a British flag hoisted.
All this was too much for Monsieur to bear; and a scuffle took place, in an
attempt to haul the flag down. On the play night, an O.P. row was
expected, but all went off quietly.</p>

her late husband, Captain Taylor, and by losses in different speculations.
She has now retired from business, and lives upon a moderate annuity.
Her adopted daughter, Dona Panchita, who is grown a fine girl, resides
with her. Captain Taylor was a visionary, yet a good-hearted man; he
died in October, 1822. I am informed that it was he who first lowered the
Royal Spanish flag, and hoisted the Patriot flag, at the Fort, at the beginning
of the revolution.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11" href="#FNanchor_11_11" class="label">[11]</a> The
<i>Slaney</i> was stationed in the outer roads, from January, 1821, to
February, 1822. Captain Stanhope assumed the command in October, 1821,
Captain O&rsquo;Brien having been promoted. A laughable event happened during
her stay in the outer roads:&mdash;She was accustomed to signalize with the shore.
One day, a black fellow was ordered to whitewash the wall from which the
signals were made on land: he was mistaken by those on board for a signal
ball; and, by a reference, his position corresponded with the order, to bend
sails. Accordingly, the boatswain piped all hands, and never were sails bent
with more dispatch: the crew, tired of their monotonous life, felt eager to
leave, and with alacrity obeyed the command. During this time, Blackee had
taken another position on the wall: book opened again&mdash;it made the number, to
unmoor the ship. This corroboration of the first order was hailed with joy.
Another movement was imperfectly understood; it seemed to convey&mdash;send
a boat on shore for the captain; and a boat was sent for explanation.
Captain O&rsquo;Brien was astonished: the wall was examined; and there they
found the black man harmlessly pursuing his work, unconscious of the important
part he had been performing, exposed to the ardent gaze, and
raising the beating hearts, of 150 men. At a distance of eight miles from
the shore, a mistake of this sort cannot surprise. The crew were greatly
disappointed, and, taking hold of one of their shipmates, a black man,
declared that, as they amused themselves on land by making signals with
one of his colour, he should be the answering pennant.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12" href="#FNanchor_12_12" class="label">[12]</a> The
following are extracts from the decrees issued by the government
on the occasion:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sepulchral monument, at the expense of the government, shall be raised
over the remains of the Honourable C&aelig;sar Augustus Rodney, as a memorial
of gratitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the funeral rites to be observed towards so distinguished a citizen,
the following orders shall be executed. A Battalion of Infantry, with four
pieces of Light Artillery, shall be stationed at the place where the body is to
be buried. As the corpse leaves the house of his decease, the fort shall fire
a national salute. Another similar salute shall be executed by the Light
Artillery, on the entry of the corpse into the cemetery. On putting it into
the grave, the battalion being formed, shall fire a general discharge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The general staff of the army, and the chiefs of all the departments,
shall be invited to meet at the house of the government, to accompany the
ministers during the said funeral rites.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The funeral was the grandest thing of the sort ever seen in this country.
A great concourse of people of all nations attended, on horse and foot;
not the least remarkable of whom were the Catholic clergymen. In the
detail published of the ceremonies, we read the following observations:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In addition to the civil authorities who attended, it was peculiarly pleasing
to all the Protestants, to observe the public respect shewn by the attendance
of the head of the church, and many of the most distinguished Catholic
clergymen, the Rector of the University, &amp;c.; proclaiming, in the most
unequivocal manner, the increasing liberality of this Catholic people. They
had, before, kindly granted the Protestants the privilege of a burial-ground;
and on this occasion they attended, with the greatest respect, to all the
exercises of the funeral, and mingled their sympathies with our&rsquo;s. Their
high-minded example in this instance is at once indicative of the elevation
and nobleness of their character, and worthy the imitation of Christians of
every name and country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Rivadavia made an oration over the grave; the concluding words
ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Illustrious soul of C&aelig;sar Augustus Rodney! return to the bosom of thy
Creator, with the elevation and confidence to which you are entitled. Being
his image here on earth, separate not thy compassionate regard from this
country, which is so highly honoured in preserving your remains. Yes, we
will preserve them, as the most precious treasure that this soil can receive.&rdquo;<!--added &rdquo;-->
[<i>Taking some earth in his hand.</i>] &ldquo;And thou earth! that art going to
cover these venerable remains, receive also the honour of being mingled
with the most fruitful seeds of virtue, and cause it to produce similar heroes,
that may immortalize the American name.&rdquo;</p>

translation of O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s work, in French, has appeared in Buenos
Ayres, with the consequent conclusion, that Sir Hudson Lowe must be a
perfect brute. In Spanish, we have one or two diatribes against the British
government, and their tyranny exercised on the seas; but the malignity so
apparent in the observations destroys their effect.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14" href="#FNanchor_14_14" class="label">[14]</a> Foreign
nations duly appreciate this invaluable discovery. In England
alone, the birth-place of its immortal author, a portion (I believe, a very
small one) still persist in denying its efficacy: &ldquo;A prophet is no prophet
in his own country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another accomplished and elegant girl, whom we Englishmen have named

remember once meeting a Frenchman at Paris, whom I had known
at London in rather indifferent circumstances. He had obtained an office
in the palace of the Thuilleries; and, upon my congratulating him thereon,
he said, that it was all very well, except the d&mdash;&mdash;d hat business. On
asking for an explanation, he stated, that, being a public officer, he was
obliged to take his hat off so often, that it cost him &pound;30 per annum for that
single article.</p>

washerwomen of Buenos Ayres present a singular spectacle to a
stranger. They pursue their avocation on the beach; and this soap-sud
army extends for nearly two miles: all the washing of the town is performed
there, by black women-slaves, and servants. At a distance upon the water,
it looks like surf breaking upon the shore. They wash well, extending
the linen upon the ground to dry. Robberies amongst them are punished
by ducking. A wedding, or other joyous ceremony, is celebrated with
African magnificence: a canopy is formed from the linen, and the heroine
of the day placed under it; red handkerchiefs for flags are carried upon
sticks, with saucepans, drums, &amp;c. They dance pas-seuls, after the mode
of Guinea and Mosambique, I presume. The music consists of singing and
clapping of hands; thunders of applause follow&mdash;Parisot and Angiolini
never received more; a general shout ends the entertainments. Their adherence
to African customs is a peculiar trait. At the approach of rain,
confusion seems at its height, and &ldquo;chaos come again;&rdquo; the ladies hurrying
in all directions, to save their linen from &ldquo;the pitiless storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18" href="#FNanchor_18_18" class="label">[18]</a> I
heard a slave boy once complaining, that he was a most unfortunate
fellow, in having been born only one day before the decree passed for the
abolition of slavery: &ldquo;Could I have remained unborn,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;only one

<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19" href="#FNanchor_19_19" class="label">[19]</a> Great
curiosity was excited by the arrival in the brig Rhoda from
London, of three English draught horses and a mare, sent out by Mr. Rivadavia,
as a present to the government. The animals were landed in good
condition, notwithstanding their having endured a confinement of thirteen
weeks on board ship. Their great size and muscular appearance excited
universal admiration. What would the Buenos Ayreans say, could they see
our regiments of Life-Guards, and heavy cavalry, and the cattle in the
brewer&rsquo;s drays and coal waggons? An English groom attended the horses
to the stables, and numbers went to view them there.</p>

<p>I am afraid, that the sanguine hopes of improving the breed of horses, in
this country, by the introduction of English ones, will not be realized; for,
in spite of their boasted climate and pastures, I am persuaded, neither will
be found congenial to our horses, who, being accustomed to the ever-verdant
plains of England, can ill bear the long drought and oppressive heat of this
country. The people, too, are prejudiced in favour of their own cattle; and
were they to pay attention to them, they would indeed be excellent; but
their treatment of horses may be compared to the manner in which Esquimaux
treat their dogs. Comfortable stabling and grooming are unknown
here. Horses are so cheap and plentiful, they are little valued.</p>

<p>Some English blood horses, for Mr. W. P. Robertson, of this place, unfortunately
perished during the passage from England. Had they arrived,
the Buenos Ayreans might have witnessed the hunter and draught horse of
Great Britain. Our countrymen in Buenos Ayres seemed highly delighted
to see their country horses; and, as they passed the beach, the sailors eyed
the animals with rapture, commenting upon their noble appearance.</p>

<p>A quantity of English sheep, stated to be Merinos, likewise came out in
the Rhoda.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20" href="#FNanchor_20_20" class="label">[20]</a> On
the second day of the fair, it blew a gale of wind, in which a boat,
belonging to H.M. brig of war, <i>Plover</i>, was upset, between the inner and
outer roads, and five men were drowned. A subscription was opened for
their families, in England, and 500 dollars were collected. Mr. Poussett,
the vice-consul, generously exerted himself to forward this charitable act.</p>

number of American vessels in 1824, compared with former years,
is very great. They were chiefly laden with flour, which, although now a
losing speculation, has, lately, been beneficial.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26" href="#FNanchor_26_26" class="label">[26]</a> Englishmen,
on their first visit to France, soon after the peace of 1814, were
eager to receive French gold; but they soon tired of it, and asked for
paper. I was at Peregaux and Lafitte&rsquo;s banking-house at Paris, when
an application of that nature was made: the clerk replied, that France
must first get credit, before she could venture upon bank-notes.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27" href="#FNanchor_27_27" class="label">[27]</a> A
book entitled <cite>A History of the Jesuits</cite>, but which is chiefly filled
with attacks upon the Roman Catholic faith, holds out Stonyhurst College
as pregnant with danger, asserting that it has already increased the number
of Catholics in its immediate vicinity. Lancashire has always been a
catholic county, and it is to be expected that people will crowd to a
neighbourhood that contains edifices devoted to their manner of worship.
I cannot believe that any considerable number of Proselytes has been made:
we are too sensible of the happiness enjoyed under our own, to be caught
with the glare of another church.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_28_28" id="Footnote_28_28" href="#FNanchor_28_28" class="label">[28]</a> Many
of the Buenos Ayreans, of the second and third grade, have most
confused notions of London. They think that all England is in London;
and in speaking of the arrival of a vessel from Liverpool, Falmouth, or any
other port, they add Liverpool in London, Falmouth in London; and when
speaking of English passengers arriving, no matter from what part, they
are all from London. Seeing so many Englishmen in their country, gentry
of the above description have the most exalted notions of themselves, and
of the superiority of Buenos Ayres over the rest of the world. We must
not blame their self-importance; for we have a tolerable share of it ourselves,
else the world has terribly belied us.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29" href="#FNanchor_29_29" class="label">[29]</a> Carts,
with a bell affixed, go about the streets vending water. The
city is but ill provided with water, that in the river being considered unwholesome.
Mr. Bevans, the engineer, has sunk the ground at the Recolator
to a great depth, for the purpose of forming a well to supply the town with
water. The work still goes on; but, hitherto, the desired water is not to
be found.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30" href="#FNanchor_30_30" class="label">[30]</a> One
cannot help smiling at the contrast which the two state engineers
of Buenos Ayres present&mdash;our Quaker with his broad brim and plain clothes,
and the dashing Frenchman in large cocked hat; the only point of similarity
is in their both wearing large hats, though differently shaped. Upon the
installation of the new governor, the usual notice was given for public
officers to attend the procession in full uniform; Mr. Bevans did attend&mdash;not
in military attire, but in full conventicle dress, as became the man of
peace, and looked a comfortable respectable gentleman. He was seated in
a carriage with a military officer, and, but for that, I could have fancied
him a wealthy miller from Uxbridge, Quaker Town, proceeding to hear the
price of corn. The singularity of Quaker costume attracted much notice,
upon the first arrival of Mr. Bevans: they stared at him in the streets, but
offered no insult; now and then a vagabond boy would call out &ldquo;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Lobo!</i>&rdquo;
Mr. B. is a very good-tempered man.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31" href="#FNanchor_31_31" class="label">[31]</a> Sir
Murray Maxwell, of H.M.S. <i>Briton</i>, lying at Monte Video,
honoured us with a visit, in June, 1824. The last time I saw this veteran
seaman, previous to his arrival here, was under a shower of cabbage stumps,
carrots, turnips, mud, &amp;c. upon the hustings at Covent Garden, when a
candidate to represent Westminster. Sir Murray&rsquo;s unaffected and amiable
manners greatly pleased the British in Buenos Ayres; and the remembrance
of his Chinese exploits rendered him an object of considerable interest. It
was a singular coincidence that the French Admiral, Rosamel, who had
been Sir Murray&rsquo;s prisoner, in the war with France, should, at the same
time, be on a visit to Buenos Ayres. The French admiral, who, in person,
looks a complete John Bull, attended the theatre, with his officers, in full
uniform. His is the nation for effect. Our officers seldom visit the theatre;
and when they do, it is in plain clothes. The French naval uniform appears
more like a military one&mdash;the blue coat, buttoned close to the neck,
and tassels.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_32_32" id="Footnote_32_32" href="#FNanchor_32_32" class="label">[32]</a> These
Colorados are all cavalry. I saw them drawn up in the Plaza;
and, whilst gazing at the singularity of their appearance, one of them
claimed me a countryman of his. He spoke to me in English, and told
me he had been fourteen years in the country. He was, probably, one of
Beresford&rsquo;s men; many of whom, as well as deserters from Whitelock&rsquo;s
army, are to be found in the province. Some of them, from having been so
long accustomed to the Spanish language, have absolutely forgotten their
own; of this I have known several instances.</p>

<p>These British deserters find various employments. Hearing an Irish
cobler, one day, in a miserable stall, bewailing his sad lot, and regretting
that he had left the army; I asked him what army? &ldquo;By Jasus,&rdquo; said
he, one of &ldquo;Whitelock&rsquo;s regiment; and if I was in it now, I should have a
comfortable pension by this time.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Why did you leave it?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;They
embarked without me.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Or, in other words, you deserted.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;By the
powers! you have hit it; and a bad day&rsquo;s job I made of it,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33" href="#FNanchor_33_33" class="label">[33]</a> A
great deal of money was made and lost by speculators, at the time
privateering was allowed in Buenos Ayres. The last vessel that sailed was
the <i>Heroine</i> (formerly the French <i>Braak</i>), commanded by a North American,
named Mason, and which was captured by the Portuguese frigate <i>Perola</i>.
Mason has been confined at Lisbon, more than two years. His wife, an
English lady, and large family, reside in Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_34_34" id="Footnote_34_34" href="#FNanchor_34_34" class="label">[34]</a> The
arrival of a Brazilian frigate <i>Maria de Gloria</i>, of thirty-two guns,
Captain Beaurepaire, on 7th March, 1825, caused much conversation and
speculation upon their errand; such as coming to demand satisfaction for
insults offered to their consul, &amp;c. A burlesque letter appeared in the
<cite>Argentina</cite> newspaper upon the subject. Considerable animosity exists
against the Brazilians, in consequence of their continuing to occupy the
other side of the river. The frigate departed on 16th March. The officers
appeared well-behaved men.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_35_35" id="Footnote_35_35" href="#FNanchor_35_35" class="label">[35]</a> It
is amusing to hear the opinion which most foreigners entertain of his
majesty George IV.<!--added .--> of Great Britain. They fancy him another Don
Giovanni. I was riding with a Portuguese officer, near Colonia, one evening
in December, 1821, when we heard the discharge of minute guns fired
from H.M.S. <i>Slaney</i>, in the outer roads of Buenos Ayres, upon the death
of the Queen. I explained to the Portuguese the cause of the firing: he
smiled, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Is it possible that your libertine King has ordered
a mourning salvo upon such an occasion? surely it must mean a rejoicing.&rdquo;
The people in Colonia, I found, harboured pretty much the same opinion;
so I thought it behoved me, as a good and loyal subject, to take up the cudgels
in defence of his majesty, of whom I am a great admirer; and I took great
pains to impress upon them, that the chief failings laid to his majesty&rsquo;s
charge were nothing more than those so common with our countrymen,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i> a too enthusiastic devotion at the shrines of Venus and Bacchus.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_36_36" id="Footnote_36_36" href="#FNanchor_36_36" class="label">[36]</a> Among
the toasts given at one of the banquets held in honour of the
victory of Ayacucho, Mr. Canning&rsquo;s health was drank in the following
terms:&mdash;&ldquo;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">El Sabio Ministro de Inglaterra, el primer Estadista del mundo,
el Honorable George Canning, fiel amigo de la libertad! la justicia preside en
sus deliberaciones; su nombre sera un motivo de placer para nostros, y para las
generaciones que nos sucedan.</i>&rdquo; Translation: &ldquo;The learned Minister of
England, the first Statesman in the world, the Honourable George
Canning, the faithful friend of liberty! justice presides in his deliberations;
his name will be an honour to place amongst our&rsquo;s, and the generations
which succeed us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Canning is highly popular in Buenos Ayres, especially with the
Creolian part of the inhabitants: a report that he had resigned office,
created much uneasiness, as he is looked up to as the firmest friend of
South American liberty. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&eacute;clat</i> of his ministerial career throws into the
shade the Castlereagh quarrel, and his alleged desertion of the King in the
affair of the Queen. Such appears to be Mr. Canning&rsquo;s popularity, that his
enemies may now &ldquo;scoff in safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_37_37" id="Footnote_37_37" href="#FNanchor_37_37" class="label">[37]</a> Senor
Don Valentin Gomez belongs to the clergy: he has talents and
eloquence, and is withal a handsome man, with a face as rosy as an English
fox-hunter. As he was returning from Rio, in the British brig <i>Agenoria</i>,
the brig struck upon the English bank in the river Plate, on the 11th March,
1824: there were eleven passengers on board. The captain left the vessel
to get assistance, which was promptly dispatched from Buenos Ayres; but
before any thing effectual could be done, eleven persons had quitted the wreck,
on four rafts: one was picked up by a Portuguese vessel, containing five
persons, who, after enduring great misery, arrived at Rio Janeiro; of the
other three no tidings have since been heard. Those that remained on the
wreck, amongst whom was Mr. Gomez, and Mr. George Brittain, an Englishman,
were preserved: they, too, encountered great privations. This misfortune
caused great anxiety in Buenos Ayres, from the extensive connections
of Senor Gomez, and his secretary, Lucca, a young man of considerable
acquirements, and who was one that perished. The brig of war, in the outer
roads, was ordered to signalize, should she gain information from vessels
arriving; and, on doing so, the Fort fired a gun, and hoisted a flag; crowds
went to the beach. Upon Padre Gomez&rsquo;s arrival, he was met by relations
and friends, the females crying for joy. The sufferings of the Padre had not
blanched the roses in his cheeks: he came on shore as blooming as ever.
Blame has been attributed to the captain: he had often navigated this
river, and, perhaps, was too confident. A Danish and American ship passed
at the time of the wreck, and have been much censured for not rendering
assistance.</p>

<div class="smfont">
<h4>RULES OF THE PORT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 1. <big><b>T</b></big><small>HE</small> guard ship, in the inner roads, on observing a
vessel anchor in the outer roads, will hoist a red flag at the mizen
mast, as a signal to the captain of the vessel which has arrived, to proceed
towards the shore in his boat.</p>

<p>2. The said captain, taking with him his papers, will go on board
the guard ship.</p>

<p>3. On the arrival of the boat, the commandant of the guard ship will
desire her to anchor astern, and will then hoist a yellow flag, for the
health boat to come and pass the visit.</p>

<p>4. The commandant of the guard ship must not permit any communication
between his crew and those of the boat, until after the
health visit.</p>

<p>5. The captain will be interrogated by the health and war visit; and
if he does not answer truly, he will be tried by the laws of the country.</p>

<p>6. If the weather will not permit the health-boat to pass the visit,
the commandant of the guard-ship will wait till they make signals from
the shore. Those signals will generally be, to permit the boat of the
vessel which has arrived to disembark on the quay. If, nevertheless,
the weather be too boisterous, and the boat cannot come on shore, the
commandant of the guard-ship may permit the crew to go on board
him, and then the guard-ship herself will be considered in a state of
quarantine, and must not communicate with any person, be who they
may, until after the health visit has passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">-&nbsp;168&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>7. When the health visit has fulfilled her office, the commandant of
the guard-ship will strike the red and yellow flags, mentioned in the
Articles 1st and 3d.</p>

<p>8. Having permission to communicate with the shore, captains will
present themselves at the Captain of the Port&rsquo;s office, where they will
fully inform him of the police of the port.</p>

<p>9. On arriving at the anchorage of Point Lara, captains who wish to
enter the port of Ensenada, will hoist a flag at the mizen-mast, proceed
to the vicinity of the fortress, and there wait the health and war visit.
They are expressly forbidden to communicate with any person, under
the penalties established by the quarantine laws.</p>

<p>10. Ships of war are an exception; they are not required to conform
to the above articles.</p>

<p>11. All ships of war, in which the crew may be attacked by a contagious
disorder, will hoist a yellow flag, and be subject to the laws of
quarantine.</p>

<h4>ANCHORAGE DUES.</h4>

<p>For foreign vessels, by the ton, four reals.</p>

<p>For national vessels, from foreign parts, two reals.</p>

<p>The dues mentioned in the two preceding articles must be paid, half
on arrival, and half on the departure of the vessel.</p>

<p>National and foreign vessels, which neither take nor receive cargo,
will only pay half the dues mentioned above.</p>

<p>Foreign vessels will pay, besides, on their entry, twelve dollars for
the health visit, and twelve dollars more upon their departure for the
health certificate.</p>

<p>National vessels only pay half for the visit and the health certificate.</p>

<p>The charges for pilots are included in the anchorage dues.</p>

<h4>POLICE OF THE PORT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 1. Every vessel anchored in the port of Buenos Ayres
must mutually render each other assistance, in case of drifting, or other
risk of average. Those who refuse will be subject to the sentence and
penalties prescribed by law.</p>

<p>2. In consequence of the little depth of water, it is expressly enjoined
to every vessel anchored in the port to have on its anchors correspondent
buoys, as vessels coming in and going out, not seeing the buoys, run a
risk of striking on the anchors. Those who fail using precaution in
this respect will be responsible for the averages and losses that may
result from it.</p>

<p>3. Vessels which have not buoys will give notice to the Captain of
the Port, who will send some, with a pilot to place them. The anchor
must not be raised without a permission to that effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">-&nbsp;169&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>4. At the moment of anchoring, the regular pilots will take care to
inform the captains, that they may provide themselves with every thing
necessary for the anchorage of their vessels; and if the pilot discovers
an infraction of this article, he will immediately inform the Captain of
the Port, under the penalty of being himself punished with all the
rigour prescribed by law, as negligence in this respect may cause the
greatest losses and averages.</p>

<p>5. If, in consequence of bad weather, the anchors and cables of a
vessel fail to hold, and it can be proved that those same cables and
anchors do not correspond with the size of the vessel, or that the
cables were in bad condition, then the said vessel shall be responsible
for the averages that may be occasioned thereby.</p>

<p>6. Every vessel from foreign parts, who moor themselves in the port,
without asking for a pilot at the Captain of the Port&rsquo;s office, will be, by
this proceeding, responsible for all the averages which may be occasioned
thereby, and will have no right of claim, in case they suffer
damage themselves.</p>

<p>7. Every vessel anchored, who may have its long boat or boat
astern, and, seeing another vessel under sail, neglects to haul them up
out of the way, not only will forfeit the right to claim in case of average,
but will even be responsible for that which such negligence may
occasion.</p>

<p>8. It is expressly forbidden to every vessel in the port to throw any
thing into the water, of their ballast, or any other object that does not
float, under the penalties prescribed by law.</p>

<p>9. It is forbidden to each vessel, under any pretext whatever, except
at the moment of her arrival, to fire salutes, in the inner roads at
least, without having first obtained permission of the Captain of the
Port. The captain of a vessel who infringes upon this article, will be
placed at the disposal of the government.</p>

<p>10. Boats belonging to vessels anchored in the outer and inner roads
must go on board one hour after sun-set.</p>

<p>11. All boats found on shore after the evening gun, and until the
morning gun has been fired, will be dismantled, and the crew punished
according to the case and circumstances.</p>

<h4>PENALTIES TO WHICH THOSE ARE LIABLE WHO DESTROY IN ANY MANNER
THE LINE OF BUOYS ESTABLISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Article</span> 1. To throw a kedge anchor, or hold on in any manner
whatever to the said buoys, the punishment of the galleys.</p>

<p>2. Those who take them away, or change their places, unless it be
by the authority of government, will be punished with all the rigour of
the law, even to the penalty of death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">-&nbsp;170&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>3. They will punish equally those who make a fire on the said buoys,
or by any other means attempt to destroy them.</p>

<p>4. Every captain will receive, on his arrival, a copy of these regulations;
the cost of which will be included in the dues of the port.</p>

<p class="topsp">The Government approves the above regulations, orders them to be
printed, and fixes the price of each copy at two reals, to be distributed
according to the tenor of the last article.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Instructions</span> for sailing from the Outer Roads of Buenos
Ayres to Monte Video, by the North and South of the
Chico Bank.</h3>

<div class="smfont">
<h4><i>By the North, or Main Channel.</i></h4>

<p>1. From three fathoms in the outer roads, steer E. by S. by the compass,
until Point Santiago of the Ensenada of Barragan bears S.W. by
the compass. Off this point, you will find from 5&frac12; to 6 fathoms of
water, according to the state of the river.</p>

<p>2. When the above-mentioned point bears S.W. steer E.N.E. until
you make the Ortiz Bank, which will be when you lessen your water to
3 or 3&frac12; fathoms. This bank may be approached, on the South side,
without danger, as the water diminishes gradually. It is a very good
guide to navigate in the night, or in thick weather.</p>

<p>3. From 3 fathoms on the Ortiz Bank, steer S.E. by the compass,
until you make Point Indio. In this track, you will deepen your water
to 5 or 5&frac12; fathoms, crossing the middle channel, according to the state
of the river. Passing the middle of the channel, the water diminishes
gradually, according as you near the land.</p>

<p>4. When you think you are about 7, 8, or 9 miles from the land,
which will be in 3&frac14; or 3&frac12; fathoms of water, steer E.S.E. and coast it
along.</p>

<p>5. When Point Indio bears S.W. by the compass, steer N.E. by E.
until you see Monte Video, which may be seen about 30 or 33 miles
distant from the top of a common-sized vessel. Keeping your course
N.E. by E. you will continue in 3&frac12; fathoms of water, until you find
yourself 6 or 7 leagues from Monte Video.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">-&nbsp;171&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>6. When you find 5 fathoms of water, you will be 9 or 10 miles from
the harbour of Monte Video.</p>

<p>From the said 5 fathoms to the harbour, it will lessen to 2&frac12;.</p>

<h4><i>By the South of the Chico Bank.</i></h4>

<p>1. From 3 fathoms in the outer roads, steer E. by S. as before, until
you have 6 fathoms off Ensenada.</p>

<p>Before you lose sight of the town of Quilmes, you can see Point Lara,
which is easily known by a grove on the side of the river.</p>

<p>S.E. of Point Lara, there is a large <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ombu</i> tree on Mr. Wright&rsquo;s <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">stancia</i>,
distant about 2&frac12; miles.</p>

<p>E.S.E. of Point Lara is the Point and Mount of Santiago, easily seen
at the distance of 7 miles.</p>

<p>2. Having passed the bank of Ensenada, which runs out about 5
miles from Point Lara to the N.E. by N. steer S.E. by compass, until
you find yourself 5 or 6 miles from land.</p>

<p>3. When 5 or 6 miles from land, steer E.S.E. by compass, to keep
along the shore.</p>

<p>Before you lose sight of Point Santiago, you will see the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ombu</i> tree
of the Balandra to the E.S.E. distant about 14 miles, and is one of
those nearest the river.</p>

<p>From this <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ombu</i>, the N.W. point of the Chico Bank bears N. 30&deg; E.
Keeping an E.S.E. course, after you have run a short distance,
you will see Point Atalaya, resembling two mounts. Keeping still on
the same course, you will see many <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ombu</i> trees; and when you have
run about six miles, you will see a large grove of them, where lies the
town of Magdalene. The church of Magdalene is easily discovered,
having two steeples, the largest at the east.</p>

<p>From this church, the S.W. point of the Chico Bank bears N. 15&deg; E.
by the compass.</p>

<p>Between the Chico Bank and the land, the least water you find is
between the S.E. point and the coast; when the river is low, you have
generally about 17 feet.</p>

<p>Having passed the church, you may keep farther from the shore, as
you have likewise passed the Chico Bank; and keeping on your
course E.S.E. you will see four <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ombu</i> trees, being the last you will see.</p>

<p>After passing the last <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ombu</i> trees, the shore is level, with shrubs, grass,
turfs, and junks, until you make Point Indio, about 15 miles distant.</p>

<p>Point Indio is low level land, with only one tree on it; and to the
S.E. you can see two large groves of tallow wood and espinillos.</p>

<p>These mounts are near Point Piedras and Point Indio.</p>

<p>From Point Indio, the S.E. part of the Ortiz Bank bears N. 30&deg; E.
by compass, distant about 14 miles.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Instructions</span> for sailing from Monte Video to Buenos
Ayres, when passing by the Channels to the North and
to the South of the Chico Bank.</h3>

<div class="smfont">
<h4><i>By the North side of the Chico Bank.</i></h4>

<p>1. Being athwart the points which form the Port of Monte Video,
steer to the S.W. of the compass for the space of thirty miles.</p>

<p>2. Then change to the W.S.W. of the compass, until you can make
out la Punta del Indio, or Point Indian.</p>

<p>3. Having made Cape Indian, steer to the W. of the compass, until
the bearing of the said Cape be at S.S.W. distant 7 or 8 miles.</p>

<p>4. As soon as you have the Cape Indian to the S.S.W. of the compass,
steer to the N.W. in order to make the two first buoys of the
Ortiz Bank, which you will approach at the distance of about one or
half a mile, being cautious to have 15 feet water, in case there should
be little water in the river.</p>

<p>5. Here, you will change your course to the W. of the compass,
taking care to pass to the distance of the two last buoys, which are to
the N.W. of Chico Bank; for if the river should ebb with rapidity,
and there should be a strong current on the larboard-tack, you
would run the risk to pass too near. Continue to steer to the W. by
which means you will make out Ensenada, and the Point Lara, which
last you will recognise by a tufted tree, called the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ombu</i>, which is to the
S.E. of this point; and on the brink of the river, before you are out of
sight of Point Lara, you will perceive a small wood of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ombus</i>, situated
on the hill of the village of Quilmes; afterwards you will see the
towers of Buenos Ayres, and the vessels anchored in the roads, towards
which you will direct yourself.</p>

<h4><i>From Punta del Indio, or Cape Indian, passing to the Southward of
the Chico Bank.</i></h4>

<p><i>Observation, to know La Punta del Indio, or Cape Indian.</i>&mdash;Making
sail to the N.W. at a distance of about 7 or 8 miles from La Punta
de Piedras, or Point Piedras, you observe, to the N.W. of this Point,
two woods of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">talas</i> (American trees), visible at a distance of about
7 miles from the said Cape.</p>

<p>To the N.W. of this wood of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">talas</i>, there is a plain, which extends
about 4 miles. You will perceive then a small wood, or copse, remarkable
by a tree of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tala</i>, which forms the Point of Cape Indian.</p>

<p>When you have made the Cape Indian to the S.S.W. distance about
7 to 8 miles, steer to the W.N.W. of the compass; you will discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">-&nbsp;173&nbsp;-</a></span>
three <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ombus</i> (tufted trees) upon the hills, upon the land of the Magdalene,
distant about one league from the river. Continuing your
course, you will observe six <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ombus</i>, situated in the Village of Magdalene,
and which appear to be on the same line; at the fifth <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ombu</i>
you will perceive the Church, with its two little towers; that of the E.
is larger than that of the W. Observe, that the first buoy, placed to
the S.E. of the Bank Chico, is to the N. 15&deg; E. of the compass from
this church.</p>

<p>In making the first <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ombu</i> S.S.W. of the compass, at a distance from
land of about 6 miles, you will see, with a spy-glass, to the N.W. in
running over the horizon, and of the elevation of an ordinary-size vessel.
When the weather is clear, and a smooth sea, you will see just 5 miles
distance, the buoy which is placed upon the Bank Chico, and upon a bottom
of 3 fathoms. To the W.N.W. of this buoy, distance of 3 miles,
there is only 1&frac12; fathom. In passing one mile to the S. of this same
buoy, you will discover another to the W. &frac34; N.W. distant 4 miles.
When you have passed the second buoy, you can sail without any fear
to the W.N.W. at a distance from land of about 7 or 8 miles; because
the Bank Chico pointed out by the second buoy remains to the N.N.W.
of the compass.</p>

<p>Passing the two buoys situated to the S.E. of the Bank Chico, and
continuing to sail W.N.W. you will distinguish several <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ombus</i> situated
upon some hills. When you close in the two small woods of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">talas</i>,
upon the side of the river, then you close in to the Point of the Atalaya,
and arrive to the small wood, or copse of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">talas</i>, you will have passed
the Bank Chico.</p>

<p>Leaving the copse of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">talas</i>, the coast is very low, and presents
small regions of sand, to a distance of about 6 miles; that which follows,
and which is more raised, is the Forest of Santiago of the Ensenada:
to the end of this Forest, there is three leagues of length; it is the
Point, or Cape de Santiago of Ensenada of Barragan: arrived there,
follow the same directions that have been given in the first course from
Monte Video to Buenos Ayres.</p>

<h4><i>Observations.</i></h4>

<p>In the passage from Monte Video to the Southern Coast, the bottom
is bad, as well as in the environs of Cape Indian.</p>

<p>From Cape Indian, as far as the first <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ombu</i>, situated upon the land of
the Magdalene, you must not anchor nearer than 6 or 7 miles from the
shore, because there is a ridge of rocks, which extends itself to more
than 5 miles, and on which anchors will not hold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">-&nbsp;174&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Variation of Depth of Water from Monte Video to Buenos Ayres, between
the Banks Ortiz and Chico.</i></h4>

<p>Leaving Monte Video, having the Cape to the S.W. you will find 2&frac12;
or 3 fathoms of water; at 9 miles, you will find 5 fathoms; at 18 miles
from thence, you will not find more than 3&frac12; fathoms; at 30 miles farther,
you will have a quarter of a fathom less; proceed 33 miles farther,
and the sounding lead will give you once more 3&frac12; fathoms; in short
you will find the same depth of 3&frac12; fathoms, until you find yourself
within six miles of the Southern Coast.</p>

<p>From Cape Indian, with the 3&frac12; fathoms, steering to N.W. towards
the Bank Ortiz, the sounding lead will give you from 4&frac12; to 5 fathoms,
according as the river flows or ebbs; when you do not find more than
3 fathoms, then you will be on the brink of the Bank Ortiz.</p>

<p>From the 3 fathoms from the brink of the Bank Ortiz, steer to the W.
towards Buenos Ayres; your soundings will increase progressively from
5&frac12; to 6 fathoms, according as the river is either low or high.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the 6 fathoms, you will make the Point of
Santiago of Ensenada to the S.W. of the compass.</p>

<p>This same depth of water continues, until you find yourself N. &amp; S.
with the Point or Cape Lara. Keep always steering to the W. of
the compass, as before mentioned, and the soundings will diminish to
3 fathoms. If, during this passage, the river ebbed, you would have
3 fathoms from the Village des Quilmes.</p>

<p>By the course, and the differences of soundings above-mentioned,
you will be able to navigate by night, or when the weather will not
permit you to make out the marks.</p>

<p>Between the two Buoys which are placed to the N.W. of the Bank
Chico and Ortiz, you will find 5&frac12; and 6 fathoms, according as the river
is high or low.</p>

<p>Between the Banks Chico and Ortiz, the anchorage is good, and the
anchors hold tolerably well.</p>

<p>In the environs of the Bank Ortiz, vessels are less subject to part
from their anchors, because the bottom is mud and sand.</p>

<p>From the Cape Indian to Buenos Ayres, the currents flow from the
E.S.E. to the W.N.W.; their rapidity is much about from 1&frac12; to 2
miles an hour.</p>

<p>In tacking, when the wind is contrary, a great deal of way can be
made by means of the currents.</p>

<p>From the S.E. extremity of the Bank Ortiz, to the S.E. extremity of
the Bank Chico, as you gradually proceed up the river, you will find
yourself nearer the Bank Ortiz than the land; you will keep taking from
3 fathoms along the chain of rocks which run along the coast, until 3<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">-&nbsp;175&nbsp;-</a></span>
short fathoms on the side of the Bank Ortiz. Observe, that during this
tack, when you find yourself in 4 or 4&frac12; fathoms, you are then nearer
the bank than the land.</p>

<p>Having doubled the Bank Ortiz, you can safely proceed until you
have 3 fathoms of water; for the depth diminishes gradually.</p>

<p>In tacking about between the Bank Chico and Ortiz, you can, as
before said, run your tacks upon all the points of the Bank Ortiz as long
as you are in 3 fathoms water. But in the tacks which you run upon
the Bank Chico, you must put about ship as soon as the sounding
line does not give you more than 4 fathoms, because this bank is full
of pointed rocks, particularly at the place where the second buoy is
placed, upon the point from the N.W. to the S.E.; it is also equally
rocky from the first buoy to the S.E. as far as three miles to the
W.N.W. because on the two points you find no more than 1&frac12; fathom
water.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Positions</span> of the <span class="smcap">Ten Buoys</span> placed on different Banks in
the River Plate.</h3>

<div class="smfont">
<h4><i>Upon the Bank Chico there are Four Red Buoys.</i></h4>

<p>1st. Is placed at the S.E. extremity of the Bank Chico, on a bottom
of 3 fathoms. From this Point, you make the Magdalene Church at the
S. 15&deg; W. of the compass.</p>

<p>2d. Is placed at the S. extremity of the Bank, on a bottom of 3 fathoms.
It is situated at the W. &frac14; N.W. of the first, distant 4 miles: you
make the Church, at 15&deg; E.</p>

<p>3d. Is situated to the N. &frac14; N.W. of the second, distant 4 miles,
upon a bottom of 1&frac12; fathom; it is in the middle of the Bank. You
make the Point of Atalaya to the S.W. of the compass.</p>

<p>4th. Is placed at the N.W. extremity of the Bank, on a bottom of 3
fathoms, to the W.N.W. of the third, distant 4 miles. You make the
Point of Atalaya to the S. 24&deg; W. of the compass, distant 10&frac12; miles.</p>

<h4><i>Upon the Bank Ortiz are placed Four Black Buoys.</i></h4>

<p>1st. Is at the S.E. extremity of the Bank Ortiz, on a bottom of 3 fathoms.
From the buoy, you make Cape Indian to the S.W. &frac14; S. of the
compass: you will, at the same time, see, from the deck of a vessel of an
ordinary size, and on a clear day, the buoy, and the coast of Cape
Indian.</p>

<p>2d. Is at the S. extremity of the Bank Ortiz, on a bottom of 3 fathoms,
and to the N.N.E. of the buoy of the S.E. of the Bank Chico.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">-&nbsp;176&nbsp;-</a></span></p>

<p>3d. Is placed upon the side of the Bank Ortiz, on a bottom of 3 fathoms,
to the N.N.E. of the middle of the Bank Chico.</p>

<p>4th. Finds itself upon the Bank Ortiz, by 3 fathoms, and to the N.
of the one of the N.W. of the Bank Chico.</p>

<h4><i>To the Ensenada de Barragan, on the Banks of Santiago and Lara, are
placed Two Black Buoys.</i></h4>

<p>1st. Black Buoy is upon the Bank of Santiago, in 3 fathoms: the
bearing of this buoy has the Point of the Santiago to the S. 28&deg; E.
and Point Lara to the S. 53&deg; W. of the compass.</p>

<p>2nd. Black Buoy is placed upon the Bank Lara, on a bottom of two
fathoms, on the bearing of Point Lara to the S.E. &frac14; S. and the Point
of Santiago to the S. 63&deg; E.</p>

<p>These two buoys are placed to warn Navigators to pass to the
Northward.</p>

<h4><i>Observations.</i></h4>

<p>The Bank Chico is not parallel with the S. coast, because, from the
first buoy of S.E. you take the bearing of the third buoy to the N.
42&deg; W. of the compass. This bank is nine miles in length.</p>

<p>This Bank forms to the N. a pretty considerable bay; it extends
itself from the buoy of the S.E. to a distance of 4 miles to the N.W. In
the middle of this bay, you have 3&frac12; fathoms; but in steering to the
S.S.W. of the compass, at a distance of 150 fathoms, you will only find
1&frac12; fathom.</p>

<p>In the S. part, this bank forms another bay; it extends itself
from the buoy of the N.W. as far as that of the Point of the S. in the
direction of the S.E. &frac14; S. distance about 6 miles; and in all this bay, in
following the edge of the bank, there is 3&frac12; fathom water.</p>
